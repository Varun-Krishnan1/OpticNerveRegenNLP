Based on the context given in the sentences, it is likely that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. My best guess is that the masked molecule is "oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein" (OMgp).

Confidence score: 90

Justification: The sentences mention that the failure of axonal regeneration in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is partly due to the presence of endogenous inhibitors of regeneration, which include "nogo-a," "myelin-associated glycoprotein" (MAG), and "oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein" (OMgp). Furthermore, the sentences state that MAG and OMgp synergize with nogo-a to restrict axonal growth and neurological recovery after spinal cord trauma. This suggests that all three molecules, including OMgp, have inhibitory effects on axonal growth.
