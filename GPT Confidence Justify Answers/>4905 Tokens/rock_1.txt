Based on the provided sentences, it appears that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. My best guess is that the masked molecule is "Rho kinase." 

Confidence score: 90

Justification:
1. Sentence 1: "Synergistic effects of bone marrow stromal cells and a Rho kinase [MASK1] inhibitor fasudil on axon regeneration in rat spinal cord injury." This sentence suggests that inhibiting Rho kinase has a positive effect on axon regeneration, implying that Rho kinase normally inhibits regeneration.

2. Sentence 2: "Rho-[MASK1] inhibitors as emerging strategies to promote nerve regeneration." This sentence further supports the idea that Rho kinase inhibition promotes nerve regeneration.

3. Sentence 3: "Inhibition of Rho kinase [MASK1] increases neurite outgrowth on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in vitro and axonal regeneration in the adult optic nerve in vivo." Here, the inhibition of Rho kinase is explicitly mentioned as increasing axonal regeneration, reinforcing the role of Rho kinase as an inhibitor.

4. Sentence 4: "Interestingly repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa) inhibits axon growth by inducing CRMP-2 phosphorylation via both [MASK1] and GSK3Î² signaling." This sentence suggests that the masked molecule, in this case, Rho kinase, is involved in inhibiting axon growth.

5. Sentence 5: "A novel [MASK1] inhibitor y-39983 promotes regeneration of crushed axons of retinal ganglion cells into the optic nerve of adult cats." This sentence indicates that inhibiting the masked molecule leads to the promotion of axon regeneration.

The consistent mention of Rho kinase inhibition promoting nerve regeneration, as well as its involvement in inhibiting axon growth, strongly suggests that the masked molecule is an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration.
