Based on the provided context, it is difficult to determine with absolute certainty whether the masked molecule acts as a promoter or inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. However, based on the information given, it is more likely that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. Here's the justification:

The masked molecule, when mixed with another molecule, inhibits neurite outgrowth from explants on a homogeneous substrate.
Axons avoid growing into a region of mixed laminin/tenascin-r effects, indicating that tenascin-r (the masked molecule) likely has a direct inhibitory effect on axons.
Tenascin-r does not bind to the masked molecule or block its neurite outgrowth-promoting properties for dorsal root ganglia in mixed substrates, further suggesting that tenascin-r acts as an inhibitor.
Confidence score: 70

While the evidence points towards the masked molecule being an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration, the information provided is limited and does not provide conclusive proof. Further research and experimentation would be necessary to make a definitive determination.
