Based on the context provided in the sentences, my best guess is that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. My confidence score is 90.

Justification:

The sentence "all four cell lines produce large amounts of [MASK1] so it seems probable that the neurite growth promoting properties of [MASK1] are being masked by an inhibitory molecule." suggests that the masked molecule inhibits the neurite growth promoting properties of [MASK1].

The sentence "heat treatment abolished the neurite promotion activity of conditioned medium from all the cell lines when mixed overnight with [MASK1] heat-treated medium from inhibitory cells almost completely masked any [MASK1] neurite promoting activity" implies that the masked molecule blocks or masks the neurite promoting activity of [MASK1].

The sentence "proteoglycans are heat stable while [MASK1] and other proteins are generally heat labile so we heat treated conditioned medium and mixed it with fresh [MASK1] to see whether inhibitory activity survived heating" suggests that the masked molecule, which is heat labile like [MASK1], possesses inhibitory activity.

Based on these indications, it is likely that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration.
