Based on the context given in the sentences, my best guess is that the masked molecule acts as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration. Here is my justification:

The masked molecule is mentioned in relation to growth-promoting effects and supporting neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and central nervous system (CNS) neurons (e.g., "counteracts the growth-promoting effect," "support neurite outgrowth of CNS," "support neurite outgrowth of RGCs").
The molecule is reported to have a neuritogenic effect on regenerating axons (e.g., "neuritogenic effect on regenerating axons").
It is present in the embryonic optic nerve and intensively immunostained at the damaged site after injury to the adult optic nerve (e.g., "present in rat embryonic optic nerve," "intense [MASK1] immunostaining at the damaged site").
It is expressed by various cells involved in optic nerve regeneration, including astrocytes, Schwann cells, and Schwannomas (e.g., "produced and released by astrocytes," "expressed by Schwann cells," "expressed by Schwannomas").
It is part of the extracellular matrix and interacts with integrins, promoting growth cone motility and axonal regeneration (e.g., "extracellular matrix glycoprotein," "interaction between [MASK1] and integrins," "directs growth cone motility via calcium signals").
The molecule's expression is downregulated after nerve injury and slowly reexpressed during axonal regeneration (e.g., "downregulated in the distal nerve fragment," "reexpressed during axonal regeneration").
Antibodies that block the molecule's function impair Schwann cell migration on [MASK1] in vitro, suggesting its importance for regeneration (e.g., "antibodies impaired Schwann cell migration on [MASK1]").
The molecule is mentioned alongside other extracellular matrix components known to promote axonal extension and nerve regeneration, such as fibronectin and collagen (e.g., "extracellular matrix glycoproteins involved in neural regeneration," "insoluble extracellular matrix molecules promote axonal extension," "extracellular matrix molecules promote growth and specific elongation of nerve fibers").
Given this information, I am 80% confident that the masked molecule acts as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration.
