Based on the given context, it is difficult to determine the exact identity of the masked molecule ([MASK1]) in the context of optic nerve regeneration. However, based on the surrounding sentences, it appears that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. Here's the justification:

1. The sentences mention "growth inhibitory factors" and "injured cns," suggesting the presence of molecules that hinder or inhibit nerve regeneration.
2. The sentences state that "an appropriate amount of fibers has to invade [MASK1] and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans," implying that [MASK1] is associated with the inhibition of fiber invasion.
3. The sentences mention the "prominent cellular component of CNS scar" and "glial scar," which are typically associated with inhibitory factors preventing nerve regeneration.
4. The sentences discuss "axonal ingrowth" being halted by "sulfated proteoglycans," which implies that [MASK1], as a component of glial scars, may also have inhibitory properties.

Given the above information, my best guess is that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. However, without additional information about the specific molecule and its known function, it is challenging to make a definitive determination.
