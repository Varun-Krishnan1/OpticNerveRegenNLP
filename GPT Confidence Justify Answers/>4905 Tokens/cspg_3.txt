Based on the context provided, it is difficult to determine the exact identity of the masked molecule. However, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. Here's the justification:

The cs-56 antibody is used to partially block the inhibitory effect of the masked molecule on DRG outgrowth in vitro (Fichard et al., 1991). This suggests that the masked molecule has an inhibitory effect on axon growth.

Antibodies against an epitope found in both heparan-sulfate proteoglycan and the masked molecule (presumably a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan) increase neurite outgrowth in vitro and prevent growth cone collapse (Bovolenta et al., 1997). This indicates that the masked molecule is involved in inhibiting neurite outgrowth.

Tenascin-R and another masked molecule, NG2 proteoglycan, are strongly expressed at the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) and may contribute to its inhibitory nature (1999 report). This further suggests that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of axon regeneration.

Transplanted neurons can extend axons along long white matter tracts if they can avoid or overcome the boundaries created by the masked molecule (Davies et al., 1999). This indicates that the masked molecule presents a barrier to axon growth.

Based on these observations, the best guess is that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. However, without specific information about the identity of the masked molecule, the conclusion is not definitive.
