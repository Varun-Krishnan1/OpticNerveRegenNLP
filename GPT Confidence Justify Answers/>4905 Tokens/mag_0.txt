Based on the context provided, it is difficult to determine the exact identity of the masked molecule. The sentences are not clear in indicating whether the molecule acts as a promoter or inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. Additionally, the presence of multiple masked molecules makes it challenging to attribute a specific role to any one molecule. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a confident answer regarding the role of the masked molecule based on the given information. My confidence score for this answer is 30 out of 100.

REPROMPT: Please select an option


Based on the limited context provided, it is not possible to determine the exact role of the masked molecule as a promoter or inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. The sentences do not explicitly state the function of the molecule in question. Therefore, it is not appropriate to select either "promoter" or "inhibitor" as an option.

REPROMPT: Please select an option

If I have to select an option based on the given sentences, I would choose "inhibitor" as the role of the masked molecule in optic nerve regeneration. However, please note that this choice is based on limited context and is not a definitive answer. My confidence score for this answer is 50 out of 100.
