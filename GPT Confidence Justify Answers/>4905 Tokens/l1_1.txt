Based on the provided context, it is difficult to determine the exact molecule that is masked ([MASK1]). However, we can make an inference based on the surrounding information. Here are a few observations:

Grafts of genetically modified fibroblasts expressing [MASK1] into transected spinal cord of adult rats promote recovery after spinal cord injury.
Axon-regenerating retinal ganglion cells synthesize the cell adhesion molecule [MASK1].
Nerve growth factor (NGF) enhances sensory axon growth induced by laminin but not by the [MASK1] cell adhesion molecule.
Denervated Schwann cells express a variety of cell adhesion molecules, including neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) and [MASK1].
Based on these observations, it is likely that the masked molecule acts as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration. The molecule seems to be involved in promoting recovery after spinal cord injury, axon regeneration in retinal ganglion cells, and the expression of other growth factors like NGF. Furthermore, its presence in denervated Schwann cells suggests a role in facilitating nerve regrowth.

It's important to note that without the specific molecule identified, this is an educated guess based on the available context.
