Based on the context provided in the sentences, it is likely that the masked molecule acts as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration. Here is the justification for this prediction:

The sentence "the absence of potent neurite promoting substrates like [MASK1] in the differentiated CNS of higher vertebrates are important aspects in the context of CNS regeneration" suggests that the molecule is involved in promoting neurite growth in the central nervous system (CNS).

The sentence "promotes neuritic regeneration from cultured peripheral and central neurons" further supports the idea that the masked molecule has a promoting effect on neurite regeneration.

The sentence "are contained within basal lamina tubes rich in extracellular matrix ecm constituents such as [MASK1] collagen types iv and v fibronectin entactin and heparan sulphate" indicates that the molecule is part of the extracellular matrix and is associated with the regeneration of the optic nerve.

The sentence "retinal tissue strips were also explanted onto patterned [MASK1] substrata" suggests that the molecule is used as a substratum for retinal tissue and promotes axonal outgrowth.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the masked molecule acts as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration.
