Based on the provided sentences, it is difficult to determine the specific molecule that is masked. However, we can analyze the context to make an educated guess about whether it acts as a promoter or inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration.

In the given context, the molecule is associated with the following information:

"increase of [MASK1] after nerve injury in normal mice and rats is caused by this neuropoietic cytokine" - This suggests that the molecule is increased after nerve injury, indicating a potential role in promoting regeneration.

"retinoic acid promotes axonal regeneration of chick retinal ganglion cells synergistically with [MASK1]" - This implies that the molecule works synergistically with retinoic acid to promote axonal regeneration.

"induction of trkb by retinoic acid mediates biologic responsiveness to [MASK1] and differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells" - This sentence suggests that the molecule is involved in promoting differentiation and responsiveness to trkb, which is associated with cell development and regeneration.

Based on these clues, it appears that the masked molecule acts as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration. However, without specific information about the molecule, it is not possible to provide an absolute answer. Therefore, the guess carries some level of uncertainty.
