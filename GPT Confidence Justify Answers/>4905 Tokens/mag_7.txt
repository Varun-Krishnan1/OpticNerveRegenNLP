Based on the given context, it appears that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. Here are the justifications:

The molecule is mentioned in the context of "retarded PNS regeneration" when overexpressed in mice, indicating a negative effect on regeneration.
It is stated that the molecule can "inhibit axon regrowth" and is a "potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth from mature neurons in vitro."
The molecule is part of the myelin-associated inhibitors that hinder axonal regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS).
Studies show that the molecule is highly inhibitory to regenerating neurons and restricts axonal growth and neurological recovery after spinal cord trauma.
The molecule's inhibitory effects are overcome by treatment with other substances, such as neurotrophins and metallothionein MT-III.
Based on this information, my best guess is that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration.
