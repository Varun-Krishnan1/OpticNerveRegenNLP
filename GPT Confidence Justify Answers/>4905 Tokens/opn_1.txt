Based on the given sentences, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the masked molecule (referred to as [MASK1]). However, we can make an educated guess based on the provided context.

1. The sentence "gdnf-induced [MASK1] from muller glial cells promotes photoreceptor survival" suggests that the molecule plays a role in promoting photoreceptor survival. This indicates a potential role as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration.

2. The sentence "novel roles for [MASK1] and clusterin in peripheral motor and sensory axon regeneration" implies that [MASK1] has a role in axon regeneration, which further supports its potential as a promoter.

3. The sentence "role of [MASK1] in developing retina" indicates that [MASK1] plays a role in the development of the retina, which could be related to regeneration processes.

Based on these clues, it seems likely that the masked molecule [MASK1] acts as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration.
