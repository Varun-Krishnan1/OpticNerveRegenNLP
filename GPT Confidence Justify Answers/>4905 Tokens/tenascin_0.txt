Based on the given context, it appears that the masked molecule (referred to as [MASK1]) acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. Here's the justification:

1. The first sentence states that "the arrested growth of axons they observed might be explained by inhibition mediated by astrocytes through a physiological stop signal." This suggests that there is an inhibitory mechanism involved.

2. The sentence further mentions that the inhibition could be mediated by "anti-adhesive secreted and membrane-bound molecules such as [MASK1] and sulphated proteoglycans." Both [MASK1] and sulphated proteoglycans are indicated as potential inhibitors.

3. It is stated that the expression of [MASK1] is observed in the scar area, particularly in zones bordering the destroyed tissue areas. Scar tissue is known to inhibit regeneration.

4. The localization of [MASK1] in peripheral and central lesions is suggested to have roles as both growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting molecule, but the overall context suggests its inhibitory nature.

5. The sentence "a lack of [MASK1] expression has been cited as the cause for the failure of regeneration in the adult CNS" strongly indicates that [MASK1] is an inhibitor of regeneration.

Considering the above evidence, it can be concluded that the masked molecule [MASK1] acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration.
