Based on the context given in the sentences, it appears that the masked molecule acts as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration. Here is the justification:

The molecule is described as a non-toxic but potent inflammatory agent. Inflammatory responses are often associated with tissue repair and regeneration processes.
The molecule induces an inflammatory response that is sufficient for eliciting secondary tissue damage. Inflammation is a known component of the regenerative process.
Lens injury, which can promote axon regeneration, is mentioned along with the molecule. This suggests that the molecule shares a similar effect with lens injury in promoting regeneration.
The molecule is described as a potent macrophage stimulant. Macrophages play a crucial role in tissue repair and regeneration.
The injection of the molecule increased the number of regenerating axons by threefold compared to untreated mice. This demonstrates its positive effect on axonal growth.
The molecule is used to condition cells in a manner analogous to priming nerve injury, which is known to enhance regeneration.
Activin, a molecule known to enhance axonal regeneration, is shown to work synergistically with the masked molecule in enhancing regeneration.
Confidence score: 85

While the given context strongly suggests that the masked molecule acts as a promoter of optic nerve regeneration, a higher confidence score would require a more specific identification of the molecule or additional information from the scientific study.
