Based on the context provided in the sentences, it is difficult to determine with absolute confidence whether the masked molecule acts as a promoter or inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. However, based on the information given, it seems more likely that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration.

Here's the justification for this guess:

The sentence "interestingly the misdirected axons express [MASK1] ligands suggesting that [MASK1] ligands on axons in the anterior commissure transduce an inhibitory signal in response to receptors along their pathway" suggests that the [MASK1] ligands on axons have an inhibitory effect on the regeneration process.

The sentence "graded and lamina-specific distributions of ligands of [MASK1] receptor tyrosine kinases in the developing retinotectal system" implies that the distribution of [MASK1] ligands may play a role in regulating the retinotectal system, which is involved in visual processing. The use of the word "regulated" suggests a potential inhibitory function.

The sentence "the highly efficient response of scs to pn injury is triggered by [MASK1] ephb2 signaling in fibroblasts which guide sc sorting and migration during nerve repair" indicates that the [MASK1] signaling triggers a response in fibroblasts that are involved in nerve repair. The fact that this response is associated with sorting and migration during repair suggests that [MASK1] signaling may be involved in inhibiting or regulating the repair process.

Overall, while the evidence is not conclusive, the presence of [MASK1] ligands on misdirected axons, the graded distribution of [MASK1] ligands in the retinotectal system, and the involvement of [MASK1] signaling in the response to nerve injury suggest that the masked molecule may act as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration.
