Based on the given context, it is likely that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration. Here's the justification for this conclusion:

Sentence 1: "xcrmp-2 expression is induced by neural inducers noggin and chordin which antagonize the neural inhibitor [MASK1]": This sentence suggests that the molecule masked by [MASK1] is a neural inhibitor.

Sentence 2: "receptor also induces xcrmp-2 expression suggesting that transcription of xcrmp-2 is negatively regulated by the [MASK1] signaling": The phrase "negatively regulated" implies that the [MASK1] signaling inhibits the transcription of xcrmp-2.

Sentence 3: "xcrmp-2 is thus an early response marking neural commitment and that transcriptional control of the xcrmp-2 gene is one of the targets of [MASK1] signaling": This sentence reinforces the idea that the [MASK1] signaling influences the control of the xcrmp-2 gene, which is involved in neural commitment. Since [MASK1] signaling negatively regulates xcrmp-2 expression, it implies that [MASK1] acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration.

Sentence 4: "one study demonstrated that bmp2 and [MASK1] injection activated smad1 thereby promoting axonal regeneration": The fact that [MASK1] injection is mentioned along with bmp2, which is known to promote axonal regeneration, suggests that [MASK1] has an inhibitory effect on axonal regeneration.

Considering the consistent indication of [MASK1] as a neural inhibitor and its negative regulation of key genes involved in neural commitment and axonal regeneration, the best guess is that the masked molecule acts as an inhibitor of optic nerve regeneration.
