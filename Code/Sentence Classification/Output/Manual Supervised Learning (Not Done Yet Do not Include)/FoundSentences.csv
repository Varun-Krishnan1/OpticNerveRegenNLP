2334,"by applying bdnf directly to the cell bodies, instead of to the spinal cord injury site, we found that these chronically injured neurons were indeed still responsive to such trophic support as evidenced by the reversal of their massive atrophy, the stimulation of gap-43 and ta.-1 tubulin expression, and, most impor- tantly, the promotion of axonal regeneration into pn transplants (kwon et al., 2002).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,

3246,"taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate that neutralization of nogo activity improves cns axonal regeneration in vivo.",nogo (inhibitor) ,

3364,"in contrast, rapid kindling in this lesion model increases stimulation-evoked bdnf ex- pression in the dentate gyrus (kokaia et al., 1996a).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3365,"while standard kindling of one stimulation per day is  not adequate to initiate bdnf  up-regulation  in lesioned animals, fast kindling of 40 stimuli in a period of several hours surpasses this threshold.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3366,"it  is, therefore, difficult to clearly separate the effects of stimulation number and frequency from seizure sever- ity in the regulation of bdnf expression.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3367,the expression of bdnf protein is also affected by epileptiform events.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3368,"elevated bdnf  levels  are  reported in the ka (rudge et al., 1998), hilar lesion (nawa et al., 1995), unilateral 'continuous' hippocam-",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3369,"in general, up- regulation of bdnf protein  occurs  more  slowly  and to a lesser extent than the bdnf mrna induction in  the hippocampus.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3370,"for example, the same dose of ka that causes a 15-fold elevation of mrna levels within   6 h, increases bdnf protein levels three-fold in 24 h (rudge et al., 1998).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3371,"the spatial pattern of bdnf immunoreactivity  is  similar but not identical to that of its mrna, indicating that cellular transport (nawa et al., 1995; vezzani et al., 1999) or internalization from extracellular sources (rudge et al., 1998) may occur after translation.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3372,"in addition to  increased  levels  of  bdnf  mrna and protein following seizure activity, several models reveal a corresponding up-regulation of trkb receptor.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3373,"this induction follows a similar time  course  and  spatial distribution to that of bdnf mrna after sei- zure induced by kindling (bengzon et al., 1993; merlio et al., 1993; hughes et al., 1998), ecs (nibuya et al., 1995), pilocarpine (schmidt-kastner et al., 1996), or ptz (humpel et al., 1993a, 1993b).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3374,"following administration of ka, they find no change in the level of full length trkb, but a significant increase in truncated trkb protein, which may be used  to sequester the additional bdnf produced after  seizure.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3375,"while these observations suggest possible roles for bdnf in neuronal activity and its aftermath, pertur- bation studies are required for further conclusions.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3376,several groups have undertaken gain-of-function ex- periments based on infusion of exogenous  bdnf during the seizure event.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3377,"in the kindling model, a 7-   day infusion of bdnf into  the  hippocampus  during the initial stimulation delays or prevents the develop- ment of the fully kindled state (larmet et al., 1995; osehobo et al., 1996; reibel et al., 1996).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3378,ence of bdnf exposure lasts long after perfusion is completed; both seizure intensity and duration are diminished for up to 2 weeks after the end of treat- ment.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3379,"in this context then, it is surprising that exogen- ous bdnf enhances cell loss in area ca3 when  administered prior to and during the period of  neur- onal death caused by ka (rudge et al., 1998).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3380,"more- over, bdnf has no effect on ka-induced seizure severity.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3381,loss-of-function experiments are better suited to address the role of endogenous bdnf in seizures and their sequelae.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3382,"in mice heterozygous for the  bdnf  gene (homozygous null mice do not survive to adult- hood), kokaia et al.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3383,(1999b) found that icv infusion of a trkb receptor body (the ligand-binding domain of trkb fused to the fc region of human igg) reduces bdnf availability and delays the development of kindling.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3384,"as in the bdnf heterozygous mice, no differences in other seizure parameters such as dur-  ation or threshold are observed.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3385,"thus, endogenous bdnf signaling is an important part of the develop- ment of kindling, in apparent contradiction to the find- ing that exogenous bdnf can prevent kindling.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3386,(1999b)  propose  that exogenous infusion of high levels of bdnf results in reduced trkb expression.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3387,it is also possible that  bdnf induces distinct signaling cascades at different concentrations.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3388,"regardless of the explanation, these experiments suggest that both endogenous and exogen- ous bdnf can impact seizure development.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3389,"based on its ability to promote axonal growth in  vitro, bdnf was also suspected to mediate the mossy fiber sprouting that occurs following prolonged or repeated seizures.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3390,"indeed, exogenous bdnf enhances both the number and length of axon outgrowth from neonatal rat granule cell explant and dissociated cul- tures (patel and mcnamara, 1995; lowenstein and arsenault, 1996).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3391,"interestingly,  where  examined, bdnf specifically enhances axonal, and not dendritic, branching (patel and mcnamara, 1995).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3392,"nonetheless, slice cultures from the hippocampus of mice lacking bdnf show no difference in deafferentation-induced mossy fiber sprouting, suggesting that bdnf is not essential for this outgrowth (bender et al., 1998).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3393,(1995) observe  more  mossy fiber sprouting in fully kindled bdnf heterozy- gous mice in vivo than in wt controls.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,

3396,"consistent with its regulation by, and effects on sei- zure in animal models, elevated bdnf mrna and protein has also been reported in brains from human epileptic patients (murray et al., 1994; mathern et al., 1997; takahashi et al., 1999).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,

3400,"the time course and duration of bdnf in- duction cannot easily be determined in the human tis- sue, however.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3401,"thus, up-regulation  of bdnf is found   in both animal models and human tissue, and pertur- bation of endogenous bdnf levels indicate that this protein is important in seizure development.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3402,"the mechanism of this effect is not yet clear, nor is the role of bdnf in seizure sequelae certain.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3403,this effect is specific to nt-3; neither ngf nor bdnf expression after kindling is altered by thyroid manipulations.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3404,"in con- trast, bdnf up-regulation after seizure is enhanced by 130% in the heterozygotes compared to wt controls, despite normal expression levels prior to stimulation.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,

3709,the data is summarized in table 1. the bdnf group differed qualitatively in branching from the vehicle control group.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,

3713,thus the effects of bdnf were shown only for fibers in the correct mediolateral half of tectum.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3714,"since regenerating axons also invade the incorrect mediolateral half of tectum (becker and cook, 1987; cook, 1983; olson and meyer, 1991), it is possible to ask if bdnf has effects on these highly ectopic axons.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,

3718,"thus, bdnf changed the behavior from one in which growth was the most frequent behavior to one of stability.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3719,comparison to bdnf effects during development,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3720,"the effect of bdnf during development has been extensively studied, most notably in the retinotectal projection of xenopus (cohen-cory and fraser, 1994; cohen-cory and fraser, 1995; hu et al., 2005; marshak et al., 2007).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3721,"bdnf has been found to increase the number and length of branches of optic axons within tectum; conversely, blocking bdnf or trk signaling decreased branching (cohen-cory and fraser, 1994; cohen-cory and fraser, 1995; marshak et al., 2007).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3722,"although this would seem to indicate that the effects of bdnf in development and regeneration are equivalent, there are some salient differences that suggest otherwise.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3723,"in development, effects of bdnf were observed when it was applied to the tectum but no effect was found when it was delivered to the retina.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3724,"in regeneration, we saw robust effects with intraocular bdnf administration.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3725,"during development, bdnf increased the episodes of growth (hu et al., 2005; lom et al., 2002) whereas we found a decrease in growth episodes during regeneration.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3726,these divergent findings suggest that bdnf may have different effects in the adult than in development.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3727,"since exogenous bdnf induced extensive ectopic branching and decreased growth rate in early regeneration (present study), one might expect that it could interfere with the ability of optic axons to grow to their correct target region.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3728,"delivery of exogenous bdnf prevents these rearrangements, leaving ectopic connections (isenmann et al., 1999).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3729,"similarly, delivery of bdnf has been shown to interfere with the formation of ocular dominance columns in visual cortex (cabelli et al., 1995).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3730,thus bdnf did not inhibit axonal navigation.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3731,"with bdnf treatment most axons had branches in anterior dorsal tectum at 5 weeks regeneration compared to few in the controls, which resulted in a 4 fold increase in the number of branches with bdnf.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3732,"these results are summarized in the diagram shown in figure 7. interestingly, for fibers that entered the lateral half of tectum instead of dorsal half, no branches were seen in lateral half of tectum in either bdnf-treated or vehicle controls, even though bdnf stimulated ectopic branching in these fibers at 3 weeks.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3733,the most important result is that excellent regeneration can be obtained with chronic bdnf treatment.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3734,"assuming that a way to use bdnf to promote cell survival could be found so that it was compatible with regeneration, one solution to the side-effect problem might be to stop bndf treatment once axons have reached their target and begin making synaptic connections.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3735,"at this point, axons would be able to derive bdnf from their targets and might not need exogenous bdnf to promote cell survival.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3736,"why bdnf inhibited in situ regeneration in rodents (pernet and di polo, 2006) but not in the goldfish is not known.",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3737,"it seems unlikely that exogenous bdnf is shutting down the growth response of the axotomized ganglion cells, since it was associated with extensive axonal sprouting within the retina in rodents (mansour-robaey et al., 1994; sawai et al., 1996) and with upregulation of gap43 and talpha1 tubulin (klocker et al., 2001; kwon et al., 2007).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3738,"also bdnf does not prevent the regeneration of ganglion cell axons into sciatic nerve implants, although it appears to reduce growth distance (cui et al., 2003; mansour- robaey et al., 1994).",bdnf (inhibitor) ,
3739,an interesting possibility is that bdnf enhances signaling from inhibitory molecules found in the optic nerve of mammals.,bdnf (inhibitor) ,
