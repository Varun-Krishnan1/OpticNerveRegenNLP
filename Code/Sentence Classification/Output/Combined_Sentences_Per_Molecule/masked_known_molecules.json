cord injury. to fine tune regenerative capabilities we developed a human neural cell line expressing [MASK1] a regeneration-conducive adhesion molecule under the control of a doxycycline regulatable tet-off promoter. controlled expression of [MASK1] is desired because overexpression after regenerative events may lead to adverse consequences. the regulated system was tested in several cell lines where doxycycline completely eliminated green fluorescent protein or [MASK1] expression by 35 days in vitro. to test the role of [MASK1] in vivo after acute compression spinal cord injury of

post-transplantation expression levels of [MASK1] migration of transplanted cells and immunore- activity for tyrosine hydroxylase were higher whereas expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was lower. results indicate that [MASK1] expression is regulatable in human stem cells by doxycycline in a nonviral engineering approach. regulatable expression in a prospective nonleaky tet-off

the control of the tightly regulatable tet-off system were phenotypically advantageous in vitro and out- performed their unmodified counterparts in vivo. as predicted a critical increase in [MASK1] ex- pression over nominal basal levels normally found in h9nscs enhances their survival and migration as well as promotes loco- motor recovery after injury in a mouse model of sci. the aim of the present study was however designed only to demonstrate the possibility to regulate overexpression of [MASK1] in human stem cells. our aim in the present study was met because we could demonstrate that [MASK1] expression is regulatable. the observation that [MASK1]-expressing cells tend to form more colony-forming units aggregates in vitro and proliferate less than the cells not induced to express [MASK1] is interesting from two points of view. whereas [MASK1] is expressed endogenously in h9nscs levels of expression appear too low to enhance regeneration in comparison with hl1-on cells. here we postulate that the increased expression and density of [MASK1] at the cell surface allows enhanced homo- and heterophilic cis- and transinteractions which allows beneficial consequences in vivo. it is noteworthy that in vivo cells that are hl1-off proliferated better than hl1-on cells as observed before for neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo with [MASK1] expression being up- regulated in postmitotic neurons. similarly schwann cells lacking expression of [MASK1] proliferate more after a peripheral nerve lesion than their wt counterparts3031 interestingly [MASK1] expression by tumor

schwann  cells utilize short focal tight junctions to provide morphological stabilization of the contact with the elongating axon as  well as a small scale of gap junctions to facilitate traffic of substances between them. myelin-associated inhibitors of axonal growth are also present in fish but they seem to play a minor role in the regeneration because they are either less potent or removed or neutralized after the injury blaugrund et al 1993 or because fish oligodendrocytes contain higher level of growth-supportive molecules such as the cell adhesion molecule similar to [MASK1] ankerhold

[MASK1] is expressed in its 200 kd form and 140 kd proteolytic fragments. thus [MASK1] and the embryonic forms of ncam were seen at the interface between  rgc  axons and schwann cells. in this artificial situation  [MASK1] and ncam may function in rgc axon- schwann cell recognition and adhesion. as [MASK1]  was primarily confined to the contact sites  between axon-schwann cell it seems that [MASK1] may be involved in axon-schwann cell recognition. as [MASK1]  was primarily confined to the contact sites  between axon-schwann cell it seems that [MASK1] may be involved in axon-schwann cell recognition. however recent stu- dies showed that [MASK1] and ncam  were observed  to interact at molecular level binding to each  other heterophilically to form a complex which binds more avidly than [MASK1] to [MASK1] homophilic binding horstkorte et al 1993. however recent stu- dies showed that [MASK1] and ncam  were observed  to interact at molecular level binding to each  other heterophilically to form a complex which binds more avidly than [MASK1] to [MASK1] homophilic binding horstkorte et al 1993. however recent stu- dies showed that [MASK1] and ncam  were observed  to interact at molecular level binding to each  other heterophilically to form a complex which binds more avidly than [MASK1] to [MASK1] homophilic binding horstkorte et al 1993. 1993 the fourth immunoglobulin-like domain of ncam contains a carbohydrate recognition domain for oligomannosidic glycans implicated in as- sociation with [MASK1] and neurite outgrowth. 1997 axon- regenerating retinal ganglion cells in adult rats syn- thesize the cell adhesion molecule [MASK1] but not tag-1 or sc-1. kamiguchi h hlavin m l  and  lemmon v  1998 role of [MASK1] in neural development what the knockouts tell   us. kleitman n simon d k schachner m and bunge r p 1988 growth of embryonic retinal neurites elicited by contact with schwann cell surface is blocked by anti- bodies to [MASK1]. r and mirsky r 1995 tgfs  upregulate  ncam and [MASK1] expression in cultured schwann cells suppress camp  induced  expression  of  o4  and galactrocerebro-. plexina1 and [MASK1] can be co-precipitated with neuropi- lin-1 from ex vivo drg.

[MASK1] [MASK1] was postu- lated to play an important role in myelination. how- ever we showed previously that [MASK1] null mutants exhibited no gross abnormality in myelination. ultra- structural studies revealed subtle alterations in peri- axonal organisation indicating a restricted structural role for [MASK1] in the formation and maintenance of periaxonal structures li et al 1994. here we show that myelination in [MASK1] deficient mice is not as finely controlled as it is in wild type mice. thus in the absence of [MASK1] some glial cells seem unable to determine when where and how much myelin should be laid down. these data support the notion of [MASK1] being a glial recogni- tionadhesion molecule. a model is proposed regard- ing the roles [MASK1] could play in the formation and maintenance of myelin structure. among myelin specific proteins [MASK1] has been postulated to fulfil such a glia-axon recognition and adhesion role during myelino- genesis. first [MASK1] is expressed at the growing tips of myelin sheath and in mature fibres it is found in the periaxonal regions of myelinated fibres bartsch et al 1989. the periaxonal localisation makes it possible to interact with axonal components presumably a [MASK1] receptor magr. thirdly in vitro studies have demonstrated that [MASK1] can bind specifi- cally to neurones sadoul et al 1990 and that up and down regulation of [MASK1] result in accelerated and decreased myelination respectively owens et al 1990 owens and bunge 1989 1991. thirdly in vitro studies have demonstrated that [MASK1] can bind specifi- cally to neurones sadoul et al 1990 and that up and down regulation of [MASK1] result in accelerated and decreased myelination respectively owens et al 1990 owens and bunge 1989 1991.

[MASK1] thus plays a role in the formation and maintenance of periaxonal structures possibly through its association with signal transducing molecules such as fyn kinase umemori et al 1994 jaramillo et al 1995 andor cytoskeletal molecules trapp et al 1989. this notion of [MASK1] being a structural component periaxonally is also consistent with a role for [MASK1] as a cell recognition and adhesion molecule in axon-glia interaction. this notion of [MASK1] being a structural component periaxonally is also consistent with a role for [MASK1] as a cell recognition and adhesion molecule in axon-glia interaction. in the present study we present in vivo evidence which supports a role for [MASK1] as a cell recognition molecule.

[MASK1] might normally be required to inform glial cells where to lay down myelin and how much to lay down. 4 in [MASK1] deficient spinal ventral root seemed to favor this explanation. 3 redundant myelin in the pns of [MASK1] mice. compact myelin sheath looping away from the axon is indicated by arrows in a 12 week old [MASK1] deficient l2 spinal ventral root. perturbation of such one to one relationship in the absence of [MASK1] therefore would also support a role for [MASK1] as a glia-axon recognition molecule. perturbation of such one to one relationship in the absence of [MASK1] therefore would also support a role for [MASK1] as a glia-axon recognition molecule. such abnormalities were not observed in [MASK1]  wild type litter mates. consistent with previously published observations li et al 1994 montag et al 1994 myelination was not grossly affected in [MASK1] mutant animals indicating that [MASK1] was not essential for myelination. consistent with previously published observations li et al 1994 montag et al 1994 myelination was not grossly affected in [MASK1] mutant animals indicating that [MASK1] was not essential for myelination. 4 a massive myelin is produced to surround a relatively small axon in [MASK1] deficient pns. l2 ventral root from a 14 week old [MASK1] null mutant mouse shows a massive myelin indicated by curved arrows. for [MASK1] in the normal formation and maintenance of periaxonal organisation. 5 myelination of multiple axons in [MASK1] deficient spinal cord and optic nerve. 612  weeks old [MASK1] deficient spinal cord. increase in the proportion of unmyelinated fibres in the optic nerves from [MASK1] mutants. one possible underly- ing mechanism may involve a delay in myelinogenesis in the absence of [MASK1]. this notion was supported by an increased frequency of redundant myelin in the cns of [MASK1] mutant samples. the increased incidence of redundant myelin in [MASK1] mutants suggested a delay in myelin maturation as did the increased proportion of unmyelinated fibres. the decreased efficiency in myelinogenesis could arise from a compromised glia-axon recognition in the absence of [MASK1]. pns spinal ventral roots of [MASK1] mutants whereas it was not encountered in wild type samples scored. in contrast wild type mice showed some background of redundant myelin in the cns which exhibited an increased fre- quency in [MASK1] mutants. it seems that myelination is not as finely controlled without [MASK1]. in rare instances multi-myelination of a group of axons in the cns of [MASK1] mutant animals were seen. in these cases a larger myelin sheath was laid down on several smaller already myelinated units indicating glial cells failure to distin- guish myelinated from unmyelinated axons in the ab- sence of [MASK1]. such failures however did not happen in most myelinated fibres in the [MASK1] deficient samples. these molecules could play compensatory roles to ensure that myelination still proceeds in the absence of [MASK1]. [MASK1] expression is low trapp 1988 or not detectable during the first 15 turns of myelin formation martini and schachner 1986. [MASK1] thus maintains the normal periaxonal structure. the extracellular part of [MASK1] could act as a glue as well as a spacer that holds the glial cell membrane and the axolemma in close apposition with a 12 to 14 nm distance in between. such an interaction may also send signals to the intracellular part of [MASK1] so that the cytoplasmic collar is maintained possibly through its association with a signal transducing molecule such as fyn edwards et al 1988 1989 umemori et al 1994 jaramilo et al 1994 and the cytoskeletal molecules such as f-actin and spectrin trapp et al1989. without [MASK1] cytoplasmic collars often become collapsed or swollen li et al 1994 montag et al 1994. in addition to this structural role [MASK1] may very well have other roles in myelinogenesis as well. without [MASK1] aberrant myelin forms likely due to the myelinating glial cells failure to read the axonal signals accurately thereby giving rise to multiply myelinated fibres myelination of multiple axons formation of redundant myelin and massive overproduction of myelin for a relatively small axon. thus although [MASK1] is not essential for myelin formation it may facilitate glia-axon recognition and contact in vivo thereby enabling the proper formation and maintenance of periaxonal structures and optimal myelin production. lai c watson j bloom f sutcliffe j milner r 1987 neural protein 1b236myelin associated glycoprotein [MASK1] defines a sub- group of the immunoglobulin superfamily. sadoul r fahrig t bartsch u schachner m 1990 binding properties of liposomes containing the myelin-associated glyco- protein [MASK1] to neural cell cultures. electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis by confocal micros copy of optic nerve and different brain regions of these mutant mice 2 suggest that the axoglial contact proba bly mediated by the [MASK1] [MASK1] 8 is not affected by the plp-deficiency. the [MASK1]-deficient mouse was used to test whether [MASK1] acts as a significant inhibitor of axonal regenera tion in the adult mammalian cns as suggested by cell culture experiments. cell spreading neurite elonga tion or growth cone collapse of different cell types in vitro wasnot significantly different when myelin prepa rations or optic nerve cryosections from either [MASK1] deficient or wild-type mice were used as a substrate. these observa tions do not support the view that [MASK1] is a significant. recently in vitro experiments suggested that myelin associated glycoprotein [MASK1] a well-characterized mem ber of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily represents another and possibly major inhibitor of axonal regenera tion mckerracher et al 1994 mukhopadhyay et al 1994. [MASK1] is exclusively expressed by oligodendrocytes and schwann cells and is involved in the formation and maintenance of myelin see bartsch et al 1995 for refer ences. the additional role of [MASK1] as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration is indicated by the observation that in vitro [MASK1] exerts a robust inhibitory effect on neurite out growth from young cerebellar neurons adult dorsal root ganglion drg neurons mukhopadhyay et al 1994 and ng108-15 neuroblastomacellsmckerracheret al 1994. the additional role of [MASK1] as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration is indicated by the observation that in vitro [MASK1] exerts a robust inhibitory effect on neurite out growth from young cerebellar neurons adult dorsal root ganglion drg neurons mukhopadhyay et al 1994 and ng108-15 neuroblastomacellsmckerracheret al 1994. to test in vitro and in vivo the hypothesis that [MASK1] restricts axonal regeneration in the adult cns. behavior of ng108-15 pc12 and 3t3 cells on purified [MASK1] and myelin extracts. in contrast 38   8 of  the cells plated on proteins extracted from cns myelin of mag1 mice 10 \u00b5gwell extended processes longer than the diameter of the cell body and 50   13 of the cells were inhib ited on immunopurified [MASK1] from mouse brain 8 \u00b5gwell in agreement with mckerracher et al. myelin preparations from [MASK1] 1. we therefore tested different cell types for their respon siveness to [MASK1] as an inhibitory substrate molecule. figure 1 concentration-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth from pc12 cells by cns myelin proteins of [MASK1] and mag__ mice. nerve growth factor-primed pc12 cells were plated at equal numbers on plastic culture dishes coated with increasing concentrations of cns myelin proteins of [MASK1] or mag__ animals. ther 3t3 fibroblasts nor pc12 cells showed any impair ment in their spreading or neurite formation when plated on highly purified [MASK1] even at concentrations of up to 10 \u00b5g of protein per well rubin et al 1995. however concentration-dependent inhibition of cell spreading or neurite growth was observed on myelin proteins from [MASK1] mice with a half-maximal inhibition at - 5 \u00b5g of protein per well for fibroblast spreading data not shown and - 6 \u00b5gper well for pc12 cellprocess formation figure 1. from 1-day-old pnd1 animals were about twice as long on [MASK1] as those cultured on poly-l-lysine figure 2. having confirmed the age-dependent responsiveness of these neurons for [MASK1] johnson et al 1989 schneider schaulies et al 1991 mukhopadhyay et al 1994 we investigated neurite outgrowth from dag neurons on my elin proteins extracted from the cns of [MASK1] and [MASK1] mice. having confirmed the age-dependent responsiveness of these neurons for [MASK1] johnson et al 1989 schneider schaulies et al 1991 mukhopadhyay et al 1994 we investigated neurite outgrowth from dag neurons on my elin proteins extracted from the cns of [MASK1] and [MASK1] mice. having confirmed the age-dependent responsiveness of these neurons for [MASK1] johnson et al 1989 schneider schaulies et al 1991 mukhopadhyay et al 1994 we investigated neurite outgrowth from dag neurons on my elin proteins extracted from the cns of [MASK1] and [MASK1] mice. inhibition of neurite growth by cns myelin proteins from [MASK1] and [MASK1] mice was concentration depen dent with half-maximal inhibition observed at - 4 \u00b5g of protein per well for pnd1 dag neurons and - 3 \u00b5g per well for adult dag neurons. inhibition of neurite growth by cns myelin proteins from [MASK1] and [MASK1] mice was concentration depen dent with half-maximal inhibition observed at - 4 \u00b5g of protein per well for pnd1 dag neurons and - 3 \u00b5g per well for adult dag neurons. no such morphological changes were evoked in pnd1 and adult dag neurons by immunopurified [MASK1] even at concentrations of 5 \u00b5g of protein figure 3. strong inhibition of neurite elongation by [MASK1] has been reported for young cerebellar neurons mukhopadhyay et al 1994. to confront these cells with mag1 or [MASK1]. growth cone collapse of pnd1 and adult drg neurons was analyzed in response to addition of 5 \u00b5g of purified [MASK1] 8 \u00b5g of semipurified bovine nl-35nl-250 or 7 \u00b5g of chaps-solubilized myelin proteins from mag1 or [MASK1] mice in the presence orabsence of the neu tralizing in-1 antibody. growth cone collapse of pnd1 and adult drg neurons was analyzed in response to addition of 5 \u00b5g of purified [MASK1] 8 \u00b5g of semipurified bovine nl-35nl-250 or 7 \u00b5g of chaps-solubilized myelin proteins from mag1 or [MASK1] mice in the presence orabsence of the neu tralizing in-1 antibody. figure 4 quantitative analysis of neurite outgrowth from cerebellar neurons on cryosections from optic nerves of adult [MASK1] and.

effect of [MASK1] on neurite outgrowth from dag neu rons is of particular interest. neurite elongation from young postnatal dag neurons in vitro is significantly enhanced by [MASK1] johnson et al 1989

recombinant [MASK1] is significantly reduced when com pared with control substratesmukhopadhyayet al 1994. neurite elongation from young postnatal dag neurons in vitro is significantly enhanced by

expressing the 72 kda isoform of [MASK1] or on recombinant [MASK1] is significantly reduced when com pared with control substratesmukhopadhyayet al 1994. we observed a similar age-dependent behavior of dag neurons on purified [MASK1]. age-dependent differences in the extent of neurite elongation from dag neurons on cryosections from peripheral nerves were believed to sup port the view that [MASK1] is crucial in determining the extent of neurite growth. more recently however neurite outgrowth from dag neurons of different ages has been analyzed on optic nerve cryosections from neonatal a [MASK1]-negative substrate johnson and quarles 1986 and adult a [MASK1] positive substrate rats shewan et al 1995. these results do not support a close and causal relation between presence or absence of [MASK1] and the ability of dag neurons to extend neurites on com plex substrates. accordingly we observed that myelin ex tracts from the cns of [MASK1] mice reduced neurite elon gation and induced growth cone collapse of adult dag neurons to a similar extent as do myelin extracts from mag1 mice. these results demonstrate that [MASK1] does not interfere significantly with neurite elongation from adult dag neurons as soon as physiologically more appropriate substrates are used. neurite outgrowth from ng108-15 neuroblastoma cells is reduced on recombinant [MASK1] whereas it is increased on bovine myelin preparations after immunodepletion of [MASK1] mckerracher et al 1994. neurite outgrowth from ng108-15 neuroblastoma cells is reduced on recombinant [MASK1] whereas it is increased on bovine myelin preparations after immunodepletion of [MASK1] mckerracher et al 1994. in agreement with these observations we found reduced neurite outgrowth from these cells when purified [MASK1] was used as a substrate. in contrast to the results obtained with myelin fractions immunodepleted of [MASK1] however we did not observe a significant difference in neurite outgrowth when ng108-15 cells were cultured on myelin extracts from either [MASK1] or mag1 mice. in contrast to the results obtained with myelin fractions immunodepleted of [MASK1] however we did not observe a significant difference in neurite outgrowth when ng108-15 cells were cultured on myelin extracts from either [MASK1] or mag1 mice. neurite outgrowth assays with the immunodepleted myelin extracts after addition of purified [MASK1] or of the previously removed material might help to clarify this point. alternatively a major role of [MASK1] as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration might not become apparent in the [MASK1] mouse since other neurite growth inhibitory molecules that compensate for the lack of [MASK1] related inhibitory activity could be up-regulated in the mu tant. alternatively a major role

up-regulation of one or more other inhibitory molecules compensates exactly for the lack of the inhibitory activity of [MASK1] since we found no differences in the inhibitory activity between cns tissue of mag1   and [MASK1]--1   mice in any of our experiments. finally we consider asignificant up-regulation of nl-35 and nl-250 in the [MASK1] mutant as unlikely since in-1 antibodies neutralize the inhibitory ac tivity of mag1 and [MASK1] cns to a similar extent in all our experiments. finally we consider asignificant up-regulation of nl-35 and nl-250 in the [MASK1] mutant as unlikely since

again suggesting that [MASK1] plays only a minor role in the control of neurite elongation on complex sub strates. on  these substrates an inhibitory activity of [MASK1] was no longer apparent again suggesting that [MASK1] plays only a minor role in the control of neurite elongation on complex sub strates. that the contribution of other molecules to the inhibitory activity of oligodendrocytes and cns myelin is more relevant than that of [MASK1] is also indicated by the observation that neurite outgrowth from pc12 cells and spreading of 3t3 fibroblasts is similar on myelin extracts from mag1

application of mab in-1 increased to a similar extent in [MASK1] and mag1 mice. thus we found no evidence for a major role of [MASK1] in restricting axonal regeneration in vivo. in summary our observations strongly argue against a major role of [MASK1] as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the lesioned adult mammalian cns. a comparison of inhibitory activity of [MASK1] and neurite growth inhibitors nl-35 and nl-250 in vitro for instance demonstrates a strong effect of nl-35 and nl-250 on all substrates tested while inhibitory effects of [MASK1] become apparent only when the purified molecule is offered as a substrate. a comparison of inhibitory activity of [MASK1] and neurite growth inhibitors nl-35 and nl-250 in vitro for instance demonstrates a strong effect of nl-35

[MASK1] protein. there is considerable experimentally-derived docu- mentation of the secondary structure and conserved functional domains of the two human variants of [MASK1]. briefly [MASK1] is known to possess five regions of inter- nal homology that give rise to five immunoglobulin- like domains within its extracellular amino-terminus salzer et al 1987. it has been suggested that the modulation of linked carbohydrate moieties might occur during development as a means of regulating the function of [MASK1] in myelinogenesis pedraza et al 1991. there is also evidence that the hnk-1 carbohy- drate is linked to [MASK1] in a highly differential man- ner in schwann cells supporting motor and sensory nerves of adult mammals low et al 1994. a soluble form of [MASK1] capable of inhibiting neurite outgrowth from p6 drg neurons is released from damaged cns myelin tang et al 2001 soluble [MASK1] constitutes the great majority of the neurite-outgrowth inhibiting influence released. a soluble form of [MASK1] capable of inhibiting neurite outgrowth from p6 drg neurons is released from damaged cns myelin tang et al 2001 soluble [MASK1] constitutes the great majority of the neurite-outgrowth inhibiting influence released. [MASK1] competes with nogo-66 for binding to the nogo receptor. a mutant [MASK1] protein magd1-3-fc which lacks the fourth and fifth immunoglobulin-like domains as well as the transmembrane domain and c-terminal cytoplasmic tail does not bind to the nogo receptor or produce growth cone collapse although retains its ability to bind gangliosides domeniconi  et al 2002. this would indicate that the nogo receptor- binding domain lies somewhere c-terminal to the third immunoglobulin-like domain and n-terminal to the transmembrane domain in [MASK1]. [MASK1] expression in the nervous system. unlike nogo or omgp [MASK1] is not expressed in neu- rons it is expressed by glia in the cns and peripheral nerves martini 1994. in the cns l-[MASK1] is the ma- jor form synthesized early in development and it per- sists as a significant proportion of the [MASK1] present in the adult pedraza et al 1991. recently two groups domeniconi et al 2002 liu et al 2002a have independently reported that ngr is also a functional receptor for [MASK1]. the remaining four clones were all identified as [MASK1]. immunoprecipitation stud- ies showed that ngr does indeed precipitate [MASK1]. furthermore gain of function studies demonstrated that [MASK1] at nanomolar concentrations is capable of inducing growth cone collapse in neurons transfected with ngr. 2002 identified a 80 kda neuronal membrane protein which they had previ- ously shown to bind [MASK1] as ngr. a [MASK1]-fc fusion protein bound to cho cells expressing ngr and an ap-ngr fusion protein was shown to bind to cho cells expressing [MASK1]. 2002 have recently reported that cerebellar granule cells cultured on polylysine respond to both a nogo-a peptide and [MASK1] even after phospholipase treatment. [MASK1] also competes with nogo-66 for binding to ngr domeniconi et al 2002 but the regions in ngr required for binding [MASK1] have not yet been examined by domain deletion analysis. [MASK1] also competes with nogo-66 for binding to ngr domeniconi et al 2002 but the regions in ngr required for binding [MASK1] have not yet been examined by domain deletion analysis. the competitive binding suggests that at least part of the lrr-ct domain of ngr required for nogo-66 binding is also necessary for the binding of [MASK1]. however this speculation is com- plicated by the fact that the ngr antagonist peptide nep140 which competitively inhibits nogo-66 bind- ing and blocks growth cone collapse does not compete with [MASK1] liu et al 2002a. the most likely explanation for the absence of competition between [MASK1] and nep1-40 is that [MASK1] competes for the active site on ngr which. the most likely explanation for the absence of competition between [MASK1] and nep1-40 is that [MASK1] competes for the active site on ngr which. if nogo omgp and [MASK1] are inhibitory to the regeneration of all axons other receptors must be present on the neurons that lack ngr. although first identified as a receptor for nogo-66 ngr also appears to be a functional receptor for [MASK1] and omgp. nogo-66 lacks sequence homology to omgp or [MASK1] but it has been shown to compete with omgp and [MASK1] for binding sites on ngr wang et al 2002c domeniconi et al 2002 see above. nogo-66 lacks sequence homology to omgp or [MASK1] but it has been shown to compete with omgp and [MASK1] for binding sites on ngr wang et al 2002c domeniconi et al 2002 see above. it seems likely that [MASK1] nogo-66 and omgp share the same active site on ngr as part of their overlapping binding sites and mediate their effects through the same pathways. the co-receptors that enable ligand binding to ngr   to generate an intracellular signal are still under inves- tigation but the p75 low affinity neurotrophin receptor was soon shown to be necessary for the inhibition of neurite outgrowth from adult drg neurons and post- natal cerebellar granule cells by [MASK1] yamashita et al. [MASK1] also induces a rise in intracellular calcium levels. ngr is not the only receptor for nogo-a and [MASK1]. the interactions of [MASK1] with gangliosides have been claimed to mediate the inhibition of neu- rite outgrowth vinson et al 2001 vyas et al 2002 but see also domeniconi et al 2002 and [MASK1] has trophic effects on oligodendrocytes gard et al 1996 which have not yet been shown to express ngr. the interactions of [MASK1] with gangliosides have been claimed to mediate the inhibition of neu- rite outgrowth vinson et al 2001 vyas et al 2002 but see also domeniconi et al 2002 and [MASK1] has trophic effects on oligodendrocytes gard et al 1996 which have not yet been shown to express ngr. of course the other [MASK1] receptors may mediate func- tions unrelated to growth cone collapse. 2002 claim that phospholi- pase treatment to remove ngr and other gpi-linked cell surface molecules does not block all the inhibitory effects of nogo-a or [MASK1] on neurite outgrowth from cerebellar granule cells grown on polylysine but the result for [MASK1] contrasts markedly with the findings of domeniconi et al. 2002 claim that phospholi- pase treatment to remove ngr and other gpi-linked cell surface molecules does not block all the inhibitory effects of nogo-a or [MASK1] on neurite outgrowth from cerebellar granule cells grown on polylysine but the result for [MASK1] contrasts markedly with the findings of domeniconi et al. certainly if ngr were the only receptor for nogo [MASK1] and omgp interfering with ngr sig- nalling would be likely to have more marked effects than the removal of individual ligands. the lack of re- generation in the [MASK1] knock out mouse bartsch et al 1995 supports the view that targeting individual ngr ligands can be disappointing although full publica- tion of the phenotypes of the various nogo knockout mice may alter this view. niederost et al 2002 the absence of myelin [MASK1] and nogo from lesion sites which are none the less demonstrably inhibitory and the ability of transplanted and otherwise suitably stim- ulated neurons to grow axons in white matter. the receptors which allow postnatal drg neurons in vitro to show growth cone collapse in re- sponse to cns myelin [MASK1] and nogo  are  unknown but in vivo drg neurons do not behave as if they are affected by ngr ligands their axons do not respond to treatment with the in-1 antibody oudega et al 2000 and when drg neurons are transplanted into the dor- sal columns of the spinal cord their axons regenerate rapidly in the white matter davies et al 1997 1999.

[MASK1] [MASK1] is a well characterized myelin-specific component that has a profound effect on axonal regeneration johnson et al 1989 mckerracher et al 1994 mukhopad hyay et al 1994 turnley and bartlett 1998. it has been reported that depending on the age of neurons [MASK1] can either promote or inhibit axonal growth debellard et al 1996 cai et al 2001. for retinal ganglion rg neurons and spinal neurons the switch has occurred by birth neurite outgrowth of embryonic rg and spinal neurons is promoted by [MASK1] whereas postnatal axonal growth is potently inhibited johnson et al 1989 debellard et al 1996 turnley and bartlett 1998 cai et al 2001. for drg neurons the switch occurs postnatally with a sharp transition from promotion to inhibition by [MASK1] by postnatal day 3-4 p3-4 debellard  et al 1996 cai et al 2001. thus [MASK1] is a bifunc tional molecule with its role being predominantly inhibitory to nerve regeneration in the adult cns. although [MASK1] is normally inserted in the myelin sheath a soluble form of [MASK1] dmag also exists  in vivo. although [MASK1] is normally inserted in the myelin sheath a soluble form of [MASK1] dmag also exists  in vivo. dmag is a proteolytic fragment of  [MASK1] and contains the entire extracellular domain cleaved just before it enters the membrane. this strongly suggests that [MASK1] is indeed an inhibitory mole cule rather than a nonperrnissive substrate for neurite growth tang et al 1997. furthermore the prote olytic form of [MASK1] when released from damaged myelin after injury could exert an immediate in hibitory effect over a distance. priming neurons with neurotrophins overcomes the inhibition by [MASK1] and myelin. to test if neurotrophins can indeed overcome inhibition by [MASK1] and myelin a variety of neu rotrophins were tested individually with neuronal cultures. [MASK1]. i model to explain how priming with neurotrophins blocks inhibition by [MASK1] and myelin. activation of pka or some as yet unidentified downstream effector molecule then blocks subsequent  inhibition  by [MASK1]  or  myelin perhaps by inactivating the small gtpase rho. if however  neurotrophin  is added  to  the neuron at the same time as the exposure to [MASK1] or myelin the increase in the camp levels is prevented by  magmyelin  activation  of  a  pertussis  toxin  ptx-sensitive g protein gi  and thus inhibition of axonal  regeneration  is not blocked. activation  of  g protein  by  [MASK1] or myelin  has no direct effect on inhibition of axonal regeneration by [MASK1] or myelin. activation  of  g protein  by  [MASK1] or myelin  has no direct effect on inhibition of axonal regeneration by [MASK1] or myelin. and then transferred  onto  [MASK1]-expressing  cells or a myelin substrate the growth inhibition by [MASK1] and myelin was completely blocked. a clue to the molecular mechanism whereby neu rotrophins block inhibition by [MASK1] and  myelin came from in vitro studies of  growth  cone  motil ity. conversely a soluble recom binant form of [MASK1] repels these xenopus growth cones but the repulsion is switched to attraction by addition of a camp agonist to the culture media song et al 1998. if this is the case and if neurotrophins are able  to alter the neuronal response to [MASK1] and myelin then the question is whether this switch is dependent on intracellular camp levels. neurotrophins increased neuronal camp levels and this increase was prevented if [MASK1] was also present. further if neurons were primed with neurotrophins in the presence of a pka inhibitor the block of [MASK1] and myelin inhibition was completely abro gated. moreover artificial elevation of camp levels with an analogue of camp dibutyryl camp also blocked the inhibition by [MASK1] or myelin. finally the need to prime was abrogated if neurons were ex posed simultaneously to neurotrophins and [MASK1] or myelin in the presence of the g protein inhibitor per tussis toxin inhibition is blocked by neurotrophins without priming. taken together these results indi cate that increased camp levels and activation of the pka pathway can overcome the inhibitory effects of [MASK1] and myelin. the elevation of intracellular camp levels in the neuron is prevented by [MASK1] or myelin which by binding to the neuron activates an inhibitory g protein that blocks any increase in camp fig. in addition  the response of a number of different neurons to [MASK1] is switched from promotion to inhibition during  development. for rg and spinal neurons the switch has occurred by birth embryonic rg and spinal neurons are pro moted by [MASK1] while postnatal axonal growth is inhibited johnson et al 1989 debellard et al 1996 turnley and bartlett 1998 cai et al 2001. for drg neurons the switch occurs postnatally with a sharp transition from promotion to inhibition by [MASK1] at p3-4 debellard et al 1996 cai et al 2001. thus young neurons are intrinsically differ ent from their older counterparts and are not inhib ited by [MASK1] and myelin. the question is then what are the intrinsic differences between young and old neurons that determines their response to [MASK1] and myelin. since elevation of neuronal camp levels by priming with neurotrophins is able to block the in hibitory effect by [MASK1] and myelin we asked if the endogenous camp levels in neurons are regulated during development. pka inhibitors attenuated the growth from young neurons promoted by [MASK1] and myelin whereas an analogue of camp db-camp blocked the inhibitory effect of [MASK1] and myelin on older neurons fig. pka inhibitors attenuated the growth from young neurons promoted by [MASK1] and myelin whereas an analogue of camp db-camp blocked the inhibitory effect of [MASK1] and myelin on older neurons fig. thus the switch of neuronal response from promotion to inhibition of neurite outgrowth by [MASK1] and myelin which marks the developmental loss of regenerative capacity is mediated by a developmentally regulated decrease in endogenous neuronal camp levels cai et al 2001. furthermore the growth of drg neurons on [MASK1] and myelin was significantly increased and this improvement of growth could be blocked by pka inhibitors. drg neurons  on  [MASK1]  and  myelin

[MASK1] fyn double mutants were fertile and survived for at least 1 year. when number-coded age-matched wild-type and [MASK1] fyn-deficient males nine wild-types and 11 [MASK1] fyn mu- tants between 4

these animals were [MASK1] fyn double mutants. when animals were re- peatedly lifted up at their tails and placed back onto the platform 10 times over a period of 10 15 sec all [MASK1] fyn mutants but none of the wild-type controls displayed prominent and short- lasting tremors that could be reinduced by slightly touching the animals. figure 2 ultrastructure of  optic  nerves  of fyn- and [MASK1]

7-month-old wild-type mice and age-matched [MASK1]- fyn- and [MASK1] fyn-deficient ani- mals were therefore incubated with polyclonal anti-l1 antibodies to visualize unmyelinated axons at the light microscopic level fig. 1b and dramatically in [MASK1] fyn double mutants fig. the number of unmyelinated axons was significantly increased in age-matched [MASK1] mutants. unmy- elinated axons in [MASK1] mutants were all of small caliber and their number decreased in 4- and 9-month-old [MASK1]-deficient mice  data not shown bartsch et al 1997 see below. 2a was significantly increased when compared with age-matched [MASK1] mutants. in 2-month-old [MASK1] fyn double knock-out mice fig. similar results were obtained for 4- and 9-month-old [MASK1] fyn double mutants data not shown see below. to obtain information about the phenotype of [MASK1] fyn dou-. ble mutants in other cns regions we studied the cervical spinal cord of 2-month-old [MASK1] fyn double mutants and age-matched wild-type mice six animals for each genotype. the percentage of unmyelinated axons from the total axon population was determined in optic nerves of 2-  a 4-  b and 9-  c month-old wild-type open bars

4-month-old wild-type and [MASK1]-deficient mice and 2- 4- and 9-month-old fyn- and [MASK1] fyn-deficient mice. values for 2- and 9-month-old wild-types and [MASK1] mutants were taken from bartsch et al. a significantly increased number of unmyelinated axons was present in optic nerves of 2-month-old [MASK1] mutants 347  55 which decreased with increasing age 207  66 and 182  60 for 4- and

higher percentage of axons was unmyelinated in the optic nerve of age-matched fyn mutants 582  57 p  00001 according to the unpaired t test and this value did not change significantly with increasing age 452  93 for 4-month-old and 532  32 for 9-month-old fyn mutants fig. finally a severe hypomyelination was ob- served in the optic nerve of [MASK1] fyn double knock-out mutants. a similar degree of hypomyelination was observed in the optic nerve of 4- 801  56 and 9- 740  42 month-old [MASK1] fyn-deficient mice fig. values for fyn- and [MASK1] fyn-deficient mice were significantly different from each other at all ages analyzed  p  00001. significant differences in the number of plp dm-20-positive cells between nerves of wild-type [MASK1]- fyn- and [MASK1] fyn-  deficient mice were not apparent fig. plp dm-20-positive cells were visualized in optic nerves of 7-month-old wild-type  a [MASK1]-  b fyn-  c and [MASK1] fyn-  d deficient mice by in situ hybridization. figure 5 ultrastructure of myelin sheaths in op- tic nerves of fyn- and [MASK1] fyn-deficient mice. most myelin sheaths in optic nerves of 2-month- old [MASK1] fyn mutants  a lack a well developed periaxonal cytoplasmic collar and some sheaths form redundant myelin coursing away from the axon white dots in a or show degenerative alter- ations asterisk in a. therefore we hy- bridized cross sections from the middle part of optic nerves from adult wild-type and age-matched [MASK1] fyn mutants with a probe specifically recognizing plp transcripts. as a next step we counted the number of plp-positive cells in number- coded cross sections of wild-type and [MASK1] fyn-deficient nerves. consecutive sections of wild-type nerves were also hybridized with the [MASK1] probe and contained almost identical numbers of labeled cells 1221  110. the number of plp-positive cells per cross section of [MASK1] fyn-deficient nerves was 1302  118 a value not significantly different from that determined for plp-positive cells in wild-type nerves  p  015 according to the unpaired t test. myelin sheaths in the cns of [MASK1] knock-out mice show a variety of morphological defects. ultrastructural abnormalities of myelin sheaths in the optic nerve and cervical spinal cord of [MASK1] fyn double mutants were similar to those found in [MASK1] null mutants. ultrastructural abnormalities of myelin sheaths in the optic nerve and cervical spinal cord of [MASK1] fyn double mutants were similar to those found in [MASK1] null mutants. 2b were also present in [MASK1] fyn-deficient nerves. whereas morphologically abnormal myelin sheaths were frequently ob- served in [MASK1] fyn double mutants see below they were absent. a the percentage of myelin sheaths with an oligodendro- cyte periaxonal cytoplasmic collar spanning less than half of the axonal circumference was determined in optic nerves of 2-  a and 9-month-old  b wild-type open bars and [MASK1]- hatched bars fyn- stippled bars and [MASK1] fyn-deficient  filled bars mice. note that the formation of well developed periax- onal cytoplasmic collars is dependent on the presence of [MASK1] but not on the presence of fyn. b the frequency of multiply myelinated axons myelin sheaths with regions of noncompacted myelin myelin sheaths forming redundant myelin and myelin sheaths with signs of intramyelinic or peri- axonal degeneration was determined in optic nerves of 2-  a and 9-month- old  b wild-type open bars [MASK1]- hatched bars fyn- stippled bars  and [MASK1] fyn-deficient  filled bars mice. in comparison almost every myelin sheath ie 95 lacked a well developed cytoplasmic collar in age-matched [MASK1] mutants fig. moreover there was no significant difference in the percentage of myelin sheaths with short periax- onal cytoplasmic collars between [MASK1] and [MASK1] fyn mutants fig. moreover there was no significant difference in the percentage of myelin sheaths with short periax- onal cytoplasmic

fig. initiation of myelination in the cns of [MASK1]-deficient mice is impaired as indicated by a reduced number of myelin sheaths in optic nerves of young postnatal [MASK1] mutants montag  et  al  1994 and a significantly increased number of small-sized unmyeli- nated axons in optic nerves of young adult null mutants bartsch et al 1997 this study. remark- ably hypomyelination of the optic nerve of [MASK1] fyn-deficient mice was significantly increased when compared with fyn knock- out mice with 80 of all axons being unmyelinated in the double mutant. this notion is supported by the finding that formation of myelin sheaths in optic nerves of 10-d-old [MASK1]- montag et al 1994 fyn- and [MASK1] fyn-deficient mice was significantly delayed when compared with age-matched wild-type mice our unpublished ob- servations. alter- natively [MASK1] and fyn might initiate myelination independently from each other and the severe phenotype of [MASK1] fyn double mutant mice might result from a combination of phenotypes of the respective single mutants. alter- natively [MASK1] and fyn might initiate myelination independently from each other and the severe phenotype of [MASK1] fyn double

activity has been observed in differentiating oligodendrocyte progenitor cultures be- fore the expression of [MASK1] osterhout et al 1999. together the demonstration of [MASK1]- independent signaling pathways of fyn in oligodendrocytes is in line with our in vivo observations hypomyelination in fyn-deficient mice is more pronounced than in [MASK1] mutants. interestingly the degree of hypomyelination in optic nerves of [MASK1] fyn double mutants was significantly increased when com- pared with [MASK1] or fyn single mutants. interestingly the degree of hypomyelination in optic nerves of [MASK1] fyn double mutants was significantly increased when com- pared with [MASK1] or fyn single mutants. a possible explanation of this finding is that [MASK1] and fyn act independently to initiate myelination the severe hypomyelination of the double mutant would simply reflect a phenotypic combination of the respective single mutants. in the absence of fyn other signaling pathways might be activated more efficiently by [MASK1] to initiate myelination. vice versa in the absence of [MASK1] fyn might be activated more strongly by other oligodendrocyte cell surface molecules see above. simultaneous elimination of both [MASK1] and fyn would disrupt these hypothetical compensatory mechanisms resulting in a phenotype of the double mutant that is more severe than that of each of the single mutants. fascicles of unmyelinated axons without interdigitating glial cell processes evident in fyn and [MASK1] fyn null mutants suggest that impaired process formation of mutant oligodendrocytes might indeed be the major cause of hypomyelination. it is interesting in this context that we observed a considerable variability in the degree of hypomyelination between different cns structures of [MASK1] fyn double mutants. only moderate hypomyelination of some axon tracts of [MASK1] fyn double mutants might also explain the relatively mild behavioral deficits of these animals. interestingly noncompacted regions of myelin redundant myelin and multiply myelinated axons were also detected in the cns of mutant mice deficient in the large isoform of [MASK1] fujita  et al 1998. however morphologically abnormal myelin sheaths typically seen in [MASK1] null mutants or l-[MASK1]-deficient mice were not observed in fyn null mutants. moreover myelin sheaths of [MASK1] fyn double mutants showed similar defects with a similar fre- quency as myelin sheaths of [MASK1] null mutants. moreover myelin sheaths of [MASK1] fyn double mutants showed similar defects with a similar fre- quency as myelin sheaths of [MASK1] null mutants. all these data demonstrate that fyn is not involved in the formation of morpho- logically intact cns myelin and thus indicate that other signaling molecules downstream of [MASK1] are involved in the morphological maturation of cns myelin. bartsch s montag d schachner m bartsch u 1997 increased number of unmyelinated axons in optic

protein plp [MASK1] and my- elin basic protein mbp although schwann cells express much less. [MASK1] was expressed around both pns  and  cns myelinated fibers bartsch et al 1989 martini and schachner 1986. in the rgc re- generation we found that [MASK1] was first barely detectable at the interface region between unmye- linated rgc axons and schwann cells. later on   as myelination advanced further [MASK1] increased and continued to be present at the periaxonal surface not shown. these observations indicate there is an intricate temporal and spatial regu- lation of [MASK1] expression during the process of myelination of rgc axons by schwann cells. t 1997 soluble myelin-associated  glycoprotein [MASK1] found in vivo  inhibits  axonal  regeneration. a further inhibitory component of the cns-myelin  is the [MASK1] [MASK1] that is a potent neurite growth inhibitor in culture mckerracher et al 1994. this cascade may be responsible that inhibition by [MASK1] or other my- elin components can be overridden  and  axons  are stimulated to grow. t 1999 prior exposure to neurotrophins blocks inhi- bition of axonal regeneration by [MASK1] and myelin via     a camp-dependent mechanism. in the cns nogo-a is localized to white matter where it is enriched in the inner- and outermost myelin membrane like [MASK1] [MASK1] confocal and electron microscope immunohistochemistry data not shown. adult mammalian axon regeneration is generally successful in the peripheral nervous system pns but is dismally poor in the central nervous system cns however many classes of cns axons can extend for long distances in peripheral nerve grafts1 a comparison of myelin from the cns and the pns has revealed that cns white matter is selectively inhibitory for axonal outgrowth2 several components of cns white matter ni35 ni250nogo and [MASK1] that have inhibitory activity for axon extension have been described3-7 the in-1 antibody which recognizes ni35 and ni250nogo allows moderate degrees of axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury89 here we identify nogo as a member of the reticulon family reticulon 4-a nogo is expressed by oligodendrocytes but not by schwann cells and associates primarily with the endoplasmic reticulum a 66-residue lumenalextracellular domain inhibits axonal extension and col-. elevated concentrations of immunoglobulin oligoclonal bands in the cerebral spinal fluid have long been used as a diagnostic marker for ms and were originally inter- preted as evidence for the involvement of the humoral immune response in the pathogenesis of ms there have been many attempts to identify pathogenic antibodies in the serum of ms patients and antibodies that are specific for a variety of myelin proteins and antigens have been detected including antibodies against many of the major myelin proteins such as myelin basic protein mbp pro- teolipid protein plp myelin oligodendrocyte glycopro- tein mog and [MASK1] [MASK1]. igf\tinsulin-derived growth factor [MASK1]\t[MASK1] ngf\tnerve growth factor. elevated camp levels have the ability to neutralize the inhibitory influences of myelin and [MASK1] [MASK1] on regrowing axons or reverse the influence of inhibitory molecules on growth promotion.

neurotrophins stimulates the camppka pathway and permits neurons to grow on normally inhibitory [MASK1] and myelin substrates. they also demonstrate that pre-treatment is required because [MASK1] and myelin act through het- erotrimeric g proteins to block activation of the camppka pathway. growth of pc12 cells and primary retinal neurons was promoted on normally inhibitory myelin and [MASK1]

exposure to neurotrophins blocks inhibition of axonal re- generation by [MASK1] and myelin via a camp-dependent mecha- nism. myelin associated glycoprotein [MASK1] a minor constituent of myelin is a sialic acid binding lectin with two established physiological functions it is involved in myelin-axon stability and cytoarchitecture and controls nerve regeneration. [MASK1] is found selectively on the myelin membranes directly apposed to the axon surface where it has been proposed to mediate myelin-axon interactions. although the nerve cell surface ligands for [MASK1] remain to be established evidence supports a functional role for sialylated glycoconjugates. here we review recent studies that reflect on the role of gangliosides sialylated glycosphingolipids as functional [MASK1] ligands. [MASK1] binds  to gangliosides with the terminal sequence neuac\u03b13gal 3galnac which is found on the major nerve gangliosides gd1a and gt1b. gangliosides lacking that terminus eg gm1 or gd1b or having any biochemical modification of the terminal neuac residue fail to support [MASK1] binding. notably the [MASK1] level  in these animals is dysregulated. furthermore removal of neuac residues from nerve cells reverses [MASK1]-mediated inhibition of neuritogenesis and neurons from mice lacking the neuac\u03b13gal 3galnac terminus have an attenuated response to [MASK1]. taken together these observations implicate gangliosides as functional [MASK1] ligands. abbreviations [MASK1] [MASK1] cns central nervous system pns peripheral nervous system. both of these physiological functions of gangliosides may be mediated at least in part via their specific interactions with a myelin protein [MASK1] [MASK1]. [MASK1] [MASK1] a quantitatively minor protein in myelin serves both as a myelin- stabilizing factor and an inhibitor of nerve regenera- tion presumably [MASK1] binds to specific targets on the axon or nerve cell to elicit its physiological effects. [MASK1] [MASK1] a quantitatively minor protein in myelin serves both as a myelin- stabilizing factor and an inhibitor of nerve regenera- tion presumably [MASK1] binds to specific targets on the axon

gangliosides. when siaload- hesin was cloned its sequence similarity with cd22 [MASK1] and a cd33 led crocker et al. this proposal was advanced when [MASK1] and cd33 were also shown to bind sialic acids  eventually leading to the designation of the siglec family of sialic acid immunoglobulin-family member lectins  this family which has rapidly grown to at least 10 members appears to have evolved to exploit different sialic acid linkages in nature. certain siglec family members are highly specific for a single type of neuac linkage eg neuac \u03b13 gal neuac \u03b16 gal or neuac \u03b16 galnac whereas others appear less stringent with the exception of [MASK1] siglec 4 siglecs are found in cells of the hemopoietic lineage [MASK1] and the. certain siglec family members are

specificities for [MASK1] and smp are not experimentally distinguishable for the purposes of this review the two are treated as homologs and designated siglec 4. interestingly [MASK1] was found to bind preferentially to the sequence neuac\u03b13gal 3galnac  which is the terminus of the major brain gangliosides gd1a and gt1b see. to [MASK1] which is concentrated on the innermost peri- axonal

along with prior work demonstrating that [MASK1] binds relatively poorly to neuac\u03b13gal4glcnac ter- mini  and does not bind to \u03b16-linked neuac the above studies demonstrate that [MASK1] has

molecularly well char- acterized proteins [MASK1] and nogo  pre- sumably these proteins bind to specific targets on axons and nerve cells and provide intracellular signals inhibitory for axon outgrowth. similarly if gangliosides are functional nerve cell surface ligands for [MASK1] modification of gangliosides might be expected to render nerve cells less sensitive to inhibition by [MASK1].

together these data are consistent with gangliosides being the functional ligands for [MASK1]-mediated inhibition of nerve regeneration. the molecular mechanism by which the binding of [MASK1] to apposing gangliosides in the outer leaflet of a nerve cell plasma membrane generates an intracellular inhibitory signal in the nerve cell has yet to be determined. similarly cross-linking of gangliosides gd1a or gt1b on the nerve cell surface by [MASK1] may modulate intracellular signaling molecules in lipid rafts initiating an inhibitory signal. data supporting this scenario recently appeared  treatment of primary rat neurons with an igm anti-gt1b antibody resulted in reduced neurite outgrowth similar to that caused by treatment of the same neurons with a soluble form of [MASK1].

[MASK1] a transmembrane myelin-associated protein is a bifunctional molecule that can either promote or inhibit neuronal outgrowth depending on the age of neurons mukhopadhyay and others 1994 bartsch and others 1995. when cells expressing [MASK1] are used as substrate for neurons derived from mature animals inhibition of neurite outgrowth is observed mukhopadhyay and oth- ers 1994. furthermore immunodepletion of [MASK1] from inhibitory fractions of solubilized cns myelin pro- teins reduces the inhibitory activity of the fractions. these studies suggest that [MASK1] is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth from mature neurons in vitro. the potency of [MASK1] as a neurite outgrowth inhibitor in vivo is less clear. both permissive pns schwann cells and nonpermissive cns oligodendrocytes express [MASK1]. however it has been suggested that [MASK1] is cleared more rapidly after injury to peripheral nerves. these myelinating cells mediate neurite outgrowth inhibition via the expression of the molecules [MASK1] [MASK1] chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans cspgs brevican and versican v2 and nogo at the cell surface. indeed studies of peripheral nerve regeneration in mice with delayed clearing of peripheral myelin wld6 exhib- it a close correlation of [MASK1] levels with the rate of nerve regeneration schafer and others 1996. in con- trast investigation of cns axonal regeneration in [MASK1]- deficient mice suggests that there is no difference in the regenerative capacity of damaged spinal axons of [MASK1] knockout and wild-type mice bartsch and others 1995. thus further studies are needed to determine the contri- bution of [MASK1] to the nonpermissiveness of the cns environment. interestingly [MASK1] has a similar stage-specific inhibitory effect on drg neurons

[MASK1]-mediated inhibition is transcription-dependent and mt-iii can block the proteolytic activity of a-secretase and the activation of pkc and rho in response to soluble [MASK1]. one gene that was up-regulated under both conditions is metallothionein mt-i we show here that treat- ment with two closely related isoforms of mt mt-iii can overcome the inhibitory effects of both myelin and [MASK1] for cortical hippocampal and drg neurons. intrathecal delivery of mt-iii to adult drgs also promotes neurite outgrowth in the presence of [MASK1]. adult drgs from mt-iii-deficient mice extend significantly shorter processes on [MASK1] compared with wild-type drg neurons and regeneration of dorsal column axons does not occur after a conditioning lesion in mt-iii- deficient mice. inhibitory

responsive to mt-iii. intrathecal delivery of mt-iii blocks inhibition of drg neu- rons by [MASK1] in cultureto begin to assess whether mt-iii could encourage regeneration in vivo we first performed

whether mt-iiis ability to promote neurite outgrowth in the presence of [MASK1] could simply be due to functioning as a zinc chelator we applied ca-edta to our neurite outgrowth assay with the [MASK1]-expressing cho cells using primary cortical neurons fig. 8e overcomes this inhibitory effect of [MASK1] however ca-edta has no effect on overcoming [MASK1] inhibition fig. 8e overcomes this inhibitory effect of [MASK1] however ca-edta has no effect on overcoming [MASK1] inhibition fig. because the direct addi- tion of the general zinc chelator ca-edta is not sufficient to promote neurite

free zinc is not efficient to overcome [MASK1] inhibition. rather an alternative mechanism for mt-iii must be involved to overcome [MASK1] inhibition. mt-iii inhibits a-secretase tace activity and is down- regulated in wt drg after conditioning lesionto further investigate the mechanism behind mt-iii to promote axonal regeneration in the presence of myelin-mediated inhibitors we looked at the inhibitory cascade initiated by [MASK1] binding to its receptor complexes. in the presence of [MASK1] the first enzyme that is activated is zinc-dependent membrane-bound a-secre- tase 35. all three of the major inhibitors found in myelin [MASK1] oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein and nogo converge in the downstream activation of rho 10 13. together these results indicate that the ability of mt-iii to overcome [MASK1] inhibition is likely to be interfering with the [MASK1]-induced activation of pkc and rho. we found that mt-iii is up-regulated in drg neurons after the conditioning lesion and that it can overcome [MASK1] and myelin inhibition in three neuronal types. drg neurons that had intrathecal delivery of mt-iii in vivo are not inhibited by [MASK1] when grown in culture. drg neurons from wt mice with conditioning lesion overcome myelin-associated inhibi- tors whereas the neurons from mt-iii-deficient mice do not overcome [MASK1] inhibition. mechanis- tically mt-iiis ability to overcome [MASK1] inhibition is transcription-dependent as adult drg neurons can no longer overcome [MASK1] inhibition with the exogenous application of mt-iii in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor drb. mechanis- tically mt-iiis ability to overcome [MASK1] inhibition is transcription-dependent as adult drg neurons can no longer overcome [MASK1] inhibition with the exogenous application

inhibition of neurite outgrowth in vitro for a variety of primary neurons including hippocampal cortical and drg figs. first addition of mt-iii overcomes [MASK1] and myelin-associated inhibitors only when administered to freshly isolated neurons that have all their neurites severed by the isolation process. this is sup- ported by the observation that mt-iiis ability to overcome [MASK1] inhibition is transcription-dependent as adding the tran-. the ability of mt-iii to overcome [MASK1] inhibition does not appear to be dependent on global zinc che- lation as applying ca-edta in our neurite

[MASK1] inhibition using different pharmacological inhibitors including fasudil and y-27632 promoted axonal regeneration and neurite outgrowth not only in rgc in vitro and in traumatic lesion models in the optic nerve and spinal cord in vivo but also in models of neurodegenerative  diseases. we show here that specific downregulation of rock2 in rgcs is sufficient to promote neurite outgrowth to a similar extent as reported before for the more unspecific [MASK1] inhibitors. as downregulation of rock2 and limk1 was equally effective in inducing neurite outgrowth of rgcs on cspg and long-  distance regeneration after onc it seems plausible that the specific neurite growth-promoting effect of [MASK1] inhibition is mainly mediated via limk1 and its downstream modulation of cofilin and actinthese findings indicate that limk1 might be an interesting therapeutic target for selective regulation of neurite outgrowth. recently application of the pharmacological [MASK1] inhibitor fasudil in a rat cerebral ischemia model was shown to inhibit caspase-3 activity and to decrease infarct areaour findings thus further extend the spectrum of specific rock2-mediated effects to anti-apopto- tic signaling which could additionally contribute to the neuroprotective effects seen in vivo. although one study reported increased macroautophagy in a cell line after treatment with the

[MASK1] activation leads to phosphorylation of several target proteins including myosin light chain and mediating cytoskeletal rearrangements and disassembly in neurons and collapse of growth cones. an alternative strategy to overcome growth inhibition from extracellular factors is to influence the common downstream pathway including rhoa and [MASK1] fu et al 2007 luo 2000 mueller et al 2005. 2008 bag1 promotes axonal outgrowth and regeneration in vivo via raf-1 and reduction of [MASK1] activity. 2007 inhibition of rho kinase [MASK1] increases neurite outgrowth on chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan in vitro and axonal regeneration in the adult optic nerve in vivo. rho kinase [MASK1] is a serinethreonine kinase and  a  downstream  target  of  the  small gtpase rho. keywords rhoa [MASK1] myelin axon regeneration central nervous system. the gtp-bound form of rhoa causes [MASK1] activation. there are at least two members of the [MASK1] fam- ily [MASK1]-i and [MASK1]-ii l. indeed   the [MASK1] inhibitor y-27632 attenuates the inhibitory effect of these myelin-associated inhibitors. upon mag stimulation in cultured cerebel- lar neurons crmp-2 is phosphorylated and inactivated by [MASK1]. serthr kinase lim lin-11 isl-1 and mec-3 kinase is phosphorylated by [MASK1] leading to the phosphory- lation of actin depolymerization factor cofilin. a [MASK1] inhibitor indeed blocks rgma-induced neurite outgrowth inhibition demonstrating that rgma inhibits neurite outgrowth via activation of the rhoarock pathway. these results indicate that [MASK1] induces phosphorylation of myosin light chain mlc leading to myosin iia activation and that this effect is essential for neurite outgrowth inhibition induced by rgma. intraperit intrathecal treatment or gel foam implant of [MASK1]  fasudil and y-27632 stimulate axonal regrowth and f recovery in a sci model  l. furthermore  tide inhibitor of p21cip1waf1 [MASK1] inhibitory prot promotes axonal growth and functional recovery. intravitreous injections of [MASK1] inhibitors includ- y-27632 and dimethyl-fasudil also improve optic nerve regen- ion. inhibition of [MASK1] by y-27632 reduced the level of a\u03b2142 which is more prone to aggregation than a\u03b2140 in ad model mice.

[MASK1] is a 24 kda protein and although it may efficiently enter transected axons growing or mature axons may not take up [MASK1] very efficiently. the inability of intact growing axons to take up [MASK1] may explain why the robust regeneration that we observed was not sustained for longer distances. our interpretation of our results is that [MASK1] has a dramatic but short-lived effect on rgc axons because it is taken up immediately after axon transection but is not taken up by axons once they begin to regenerate. also it will be interesting to test [MASK1] in spinal cord models of axon injury in which axon growth can be almost an order of magnitude greater that that observed in injured optic nerve after treatment with in-1 antibody bartch et al 1995. nonetheless our data of [MASK1] treatment of injured optic nerve provide compelling evidence that [MASK1] can promote neurite growth on inhibitory substrates in vitro and helps to overcome growth inhibition in vivo. nonetheless our data of [MASK1] treatment of injured optic nerve provide compelling evidence that [MASK1] can promote neurite growth on inhibitory substrates in vitro and helps to overcome growth inhibition in vivo. dillon st feig la 1995 purification and assay of recombinant [MASK1] transferase. narito m narumiya s 1995 preparation of native and recombinant clostridium botulinum [MASK1] adp-ribosyltransferase and identification of rho proteins by adp-ribosylation. rubin ej gill dm boquet p popoff mr 1988 functional modifica- tion of a 21-kilodalton g protein when adp-ribosylated by exoenzyme [MASK1] of closteridium botulinum. to determine the proportion of long and short propriospi- nal neurons that express a given molecule all retrogradely-labeled neurons located from [MASK1] to c5 were counted until the number of cells reached 30 per animal about 10 sections per animal n  3 mice taking the first section as the section in which propriospinal neurons were first detected. to inhibit rho all of these studies have used the [MASK1] enzyme from clostridium botulinum that inactivates rho by adp-ribosylation. moreover [MASK1] was shown to activate microglia and trigger the release of nitric oxide and several proinflammatory cyto- and chemokines inde- pendently of rhoarock-activation. inhibition of rho-dependent pathways by clostridium botulinum [MASK1] protein induces a proinflammatory profile in microglia. therapeutic effects of clostridium botulinum [MASK1] exoenzyme. functional modifi- cation of a 21-kilodalton g protein when adp-ribosylated by exoenzyme [MASK1] of clostridium botulinum. propriospinal neurons whose axons regenerated into the scpn grafts originated within rexed lamina iii-vii the medial portion of lamina viii and lamina x and were distributed throughout the spinal grey matter as far rostral and caudal as [MASK1] and s3 kao et al 1977 paino et al 1994 richardson et al 1980 richardson et al 1982 richardson et al 1984 xu et al 1995b xu et al 1997.

weeks post lesion 16 animals treated with [MASK1] 10 with buffer alone and 4 subjected to the microcrush only were examined. after treatment with [MASK1] large numbers of axons extended through the

the differences between [MASK1] and buffer-treated animals we counted the num-. therefore [MASK1] applied to injured rgc axons can enter axotomized axons and promote robust axon regeneration in the inhos pitable growth environment of the optic nerve. our current investigations are determining to what extent the new permeable forms of [MASK1] will further augment this regeneration response after injury. we have also begun a series of experiments to test the ability of [MASK1] to promote regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. in mice treated with [MASK1] many axons extended into the lesion site and some axons were able to grow distances as great as 10 mm. therefore as in injured optic nerve inactivation of rho by [MASK1] can promote axon regeneration in the injured adult spinal cord. the activation of rho has been implicated in cell death after ischemia in the cns trapp et al 2001 and thus the inactivation of rho by [MASK1] may be neuropro tective. in our stud ies the putative neuroprotective effects of [MASK1] could play an important role in improved recovery and therefore it is not clear to what extent improvements in the bbb score reflect the observed regeneration. while the late recovery of hindlimb-forelimb coor dination observed at 1 month was consistent with regeneration of cut fibers it is well documented that reorganization of collateral cst fibers occurs after sci weidner et al 2001 this process could indeed be enhanced by [MASK1] treatment which may enhance spontaneous plasticity of axons and dendritic remod elling. in tissue culture  inactivation of the rho signaling pathway is effective in promot ing neurite growth on growth inhibitory cns sub strates by two different methods inactivation of rho with [MASK1] transferase and inactivation by dominant negative mutation of rho. in vivo we have docu mented the regeneration of transfected axons after treatment with [MASK1] in two different animals models microcrush lesion of the adult rat optic nerve and over-hemisection of adult mouse spinal cord. mice treated with [MASK1] after sci showed impressive func tional recovery notwithstanding the fact that mice differ from rats in their response to spinal cord in jury especially in the extent of cavitation at  the lesion site steward et al 1999. inactivation of rho with [MASK1] to promote regeneration and functional re covery after sci is simple and our  studies  reveal  the potential for a new straightforward technique to promote axon regeneration. in this study the clostridium botulinum [MASK1] transferase which adp-ribosylates rho was applied to cell cultures and cells failed to retract their  neurites  in response to agonists. moreover if the adult rat on was crushed ap- proximately twice the number of  rgc  axons were able to cross the lesion site and grow into   the distal part of on after treatment with [MASK1] compared to lesion only or treatment with buffer lehmann et al 1999. this could be explained by the inability of intact growing axons to take up [MASK1] leading to a short-lived effect. more specifically mag-dependent outgrowth inhibition is blocked by [MASK1] transferase treat- ment 27. the sensitivity of nogo action to [MASK1] has not been reported. in vivo the regeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons in the optic nerve can be stimulated by [MASK1]

inhibitory mol- ecules we tested the ability of [MASK1] to stimulate regen- eration in vivo. we crushed adult rat optic nerves and applied [MASK1] at the same time directly at the lesion site lehmann et al 1999. more recently we have tested this technique in injured adult mouse spinal cord and found that axons could regenerate for long distances after a single treat- ment with [MASK1] dergham and mckerracher unpub- lished. the simplicity of application of [MASK1] and the encouraging results in vivo suggest this strategy has great potential for further testing and development. the most successful of these to stimulate long-distance regeneration is the use of [MASK1] as a rho antagonist.

intrestingly prior uv irradiation of isolated endfeet did not affect the superb substratum properties suggesting that also in this culture system [MASK1] was not a crucial component for axonal

natural substratum for axons in vivo holt 1989 hinds and hinds 1974 williams and rakic 1985. denaturation of [MASK1] by uv-irradiation does not affect the preferential growth of ganglion cell axons on the innermost layer of retinal cryosections. similarly denaturation of [MASK1] had no effect on the superb substratum properties of glial endfeet data not shown. innervation of outer retina layers by ganglion cell axons could not be induced by coating cryosections with [MASK1]. the alternative interpretation that heat treatment demasked a permissive constituent in outer retina layers instead of inactivating an inhibitory component is chal- lenged by the observation that exogenous [MASK1] did not improve the substratum properties of outer retina layers. immunohistochemical localization of

result suggests a preference for the membranes from posterior embryonic sc it is not statistically significant because in three explants a preference for [MASK1] was observed. when grown on alternating lanes of membranes from embry- onic anterior sc and [MASK1] nasal axons showed no preference for either substrate fig. thus temporal and nasal retinal axons seem to prefer to grow on membranes from their specific embryonic target region over [MASK1]. section 4 axonal growth behavior on alternating stripes of [MASK1] and membranes from normal sc and nontarget regions. in control

temporal axons preferred the [MASK1] lanes in 8 of 10 explants. statistically however the preferences of the nasal and temporal axons for the [MASK1] lanes are not significant. when offered alternating lanes of [MASK1] and membranes from normal anterior sc temporal retinal explants did not show any growth preference n  10 figs. by contrast the same experimental condition leads to a clear preference of nasal fibers for [MASK1] lanes 7 of 10 fig. 3d 8 retinal axons for [MASK1] lanes was observed when membranes derived from the inferior colliculus were offered as a choice. taken together the control experiments show that temporal and nasal retinal axons clearly prefer growing on [MASK1] than on membrane lanes from normal adult sc of inferior colliculus. section 5 extent of axonal

attractive cues. furthermore this growth preference for adult deafferented sc membranes should be specific because it is not seen with mem- branes derived from other brain regions and because with

attractive nature of netrin-1 on fibronectin to a repulsive nature on [MASK1]. direct chemical coupling was achieved by activating the carboxylic acid groups of the adsorbed [MASK1] or fibronectin

nhs thermo scientific solution to increase the aqueous stability of the activated carboxylic acid. in addition rgcs cultured on these scaffolds extended shorter axons owing to the combination of netrin-1 on [MASK1] becoming a repulsive guidance cue. the incorporation of netrin-1 did require a fibronectin coating of pla fibers rather than the [MASK1] coating used previously19 26 as [MASK1] has been shown to alter netrin-1 from an attractive to a repulsive guidance factor. the incorporation of netrin-1 did require a fibronectin coating of pla fibers rather than the [MASK1] coating used

observation that embryonic filopodia retained their rigidity spent little time bound to the substrate and were short-lived whereas postnatal filopodia failed to maintain their structural integrity

regenerative effects of hadscs are related to the secretion of the extracellular matrix protein [MASK1] that accumulates in the spinal cord in colocaliza- tion with neural precursors. hadscs secrete human [MASK1] in the spinal cord. a distinguished feature of niches of neural stem and neural precursors cells in the central nervous system is the presence of the protein [MASK1] in their extracellular matrix 3436. we therefore investigated if hadscs would produce [MASK1] in vivo which could be related to the accumulation of neural precursors in the tissue. using monoclonal antibodies specific for [MASK1] of human origin we searched for a morphological correlation between areas of high cell density and the deposition of the protein. in a photomontage of a whole horizontal section it is possible to appreciate the high degree of co-localization between cell clusters and [MASK1] deposits both in the injured fig. immunostainings for human fibronectin and human collagen iv showed that these two proteins were also present in the cell infiltrates but the deposits were less expressive than those of [MASK1] fig. in order to support the interpretation that [MASK1] associated to cell clusters was produced by hadscs and not by the rat tissue it was important to confirm the specificity of the anti-human [MASK1] antibodies. in order to support the interpretation that [MASK1] associated to cell clusters was produced by hadscs and not by the rat tissue it was important to confirm the specificity of the anti-human [MASK1] antibodies. we used two different anti-human [MASK1] antibodies to detect the protein. the first one was a mouse monoclonal raised against human [MASK1] clone lam-89 fig. 6e which is commercially available and described as a reagent that does not cross-react with [MASK1] of rat origin. to assess the specificity of this antibody we performed immuno- stainings in rat skeletal muscle a tissue in which [MASK1] a2 is highly expressed. while a polyclonal anti-pan [MASK1] stained the basement membranes around muscle fibers monoclonal 5h2 did not recognize the rat muscle tissue fig. these results indicate that the [MASK1] matrix associated to the infiltrates of neural precursors was not produced by the rat host but instead by the injected human cells. results up to here indicate that hadscs produce [MASK1] a2 and a5 in vivo. we next used a panel of anti-human [MASK1] antibodies to investigate which [MASK1] chains appeared in the spinal parenchyma injected with hadscs. we next used a panel of anti-human [MASK1] antibodies to investigate which [MASK1] chains appeared in the spinal parenchyma injected with hadscs. out of the six isoforms tested we confirmed expression of a2 and a5 and also found positivity for b2 and c1 [MASK1] chains fig. 7k l and for anti-pan [MASK1] fig. based on the recent observation that neurogenic niches in the adult cns contain a novel type of [MASK1]-rich basal lamina termed fractones 39 we next investigated whether the [MASK1] secreted by hadscs present the same morphology of fractones. in addition we observed a reticular [MASK1] matrix fig. such reticular mesh is similar to the z-stack obtained using the anti-human a2 [MASK1] antibody fig. dapi counterstaining showed that cells appearing in the spinal parenchyma seemed trapped into the human [MASK1] mesh secreted by hadscs fig. we also found that hadscs secreted human [MASK1] which accumulates in the spinal cord and increases the presence of neural precursors in the tissue. figure 6 hadscs secrete [MASK1] in the spinal cord

accumula- tion of human [MASK1] in the same areas of the spinal cord where precursor cells have also accumulated. grafted cells produced a cloud-like pattern of [MASK1] deposition which corresponded to the location of neural precursors in both injured and non-injured spinal cord. given that laminins particularly those containing the a2 and a5 chains 36 are present in cns regions where neural stem and progenitor cells reside both during development and in the adult 34355859 we hypothesize that [MASK1] can be the molecule produced by hadscs that mediated the accumulation of neural precursors along the midline and at the injury site. in line with this hypothesis is our previous demonstration that acute injection of the protein [MASK1] alone as long as it is delivered in. although in that study we did not search for the presence of neural precursors in the tissue we did find that [MASK1] treatment led to regeneration of descending axons to decreases in astrogliosis and cystic cavity size and to an expressive reduction of macrophage spreading in the spinal parenchyma all events  similar to those described here as elicited by hadsc. this is the first time that a link between [MASK1] and the pro- regenerative effects of mesenchymal cells in the central nervous system is proposed. previous studies had proposed a connection between [MASK1] and mscs in other tissues such as the peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle 6162. however those studies were conducted in [MASK1] deficient animals in which mscs were injected exactly as an attempt to restore tissue integrity. furthermore none of these two studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the localization of endogenous progenitors and [MASK1] deposited by msc as shown here. bone marrow stromal cells have been shown to express [MASK1] a4 a5 b1 b2 and  c1 63. here we tested  whether  hadscs    in vitro produced these [MASK1] chains but we found reactivity only for b2 and c1. considering that [MASK1] a2 and a5 of human origin appeared     in spinal cord of rats injected with hadscs injured or uninjured we propose that the exposure of the cells to the spinal cord environment was capable of switching the production of [MASK1] chains a2 and a5. considering that [MASK1] a2 and a5 of human origin appeared     in spinal cord of rats injected with hadscs injured or uninjured we propose that the exposure of the cells to the spinal cord environment was capable of switching the production of [MASK1] chains a2 and a5. these [MASK1] chains secreted only after transplantation of hadsc may stimulate the proliferation and migration of neural precursors from the ependymal layer around the central canal or from other neurogenic niches around blood vessels. in line with this hypothesis it has previously been shown that [MASK1] isoforms containing the a chains 2 4 and 5 are essential components of the subependymal neurogenic niche of adult mice 36. our results show that hadscs are

repairing role of astrogliosis after cns damage silver and miller 2004. during development and following cns injury the integrations between growth-promoting ecm molecules and their receptors such as

and fibronectin expressed by ng2 cells. given the large molecular mass of cspgs and their involvement in formation of non-permissive pnns cspgs were thought to cause steric hindrance of growth-promoting adhesion molecules including [MASK1] and integrins. their growth-promoting function derives from their role as the transmembrane receptors for ecm molecules such as [MASK1] and as cell surface adhesion molecules linking them to actin cytoskeleton. analyses of growth cone dynamics on different concentrations of cspgs and [MASK1] suggest that neuronal growth is guided by the ratio between growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting molecules present in the environment snow et al 2002. blockade of \u03b21 integrin reduced serotonergic and cortical outgrowth on [MASK1] hawthorne

cell adhesion molecule receptors such as [MASK1] and integrins cspgs have at least two ptp receptors and may also bind ngrs at the sites remote from the binding domains for myelin-associated inhibitors. cspgs may suppress axon growth by blocking function of growth-promoting molecules such as [MASK1] and its receptor integrins. rgcs were electroporated immediately after purification as

[MASK1] is suggested to be one of the most effective promotors of peripheral nerve regeneration. after nerve injury [MASK1] b1 and b2 chains are rapidly downreg- ulated in the distal nerve fragment and are slowly reexpressed during axonal regeneration 30. several bridginggraft exper- iments clearly demonstrate that the b2 chain could promote growth of regenerating axons as effective as [MASK1] 63. the expression of mmp-2 table 4 and mmp-9 is upregulated after nerve injury suggesting a putative functional role in proteoglycan degradation without hindering the neu- rite-promoting potential of

transmembrane ng2 proteoglycan inhibited neurite outgrowth from both cerebellar granule cells and embryonic drg neurones on [MASK1] indicating that ng2 blocks the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of larninin dou and levine 1994. neurite outgrowth factor nof is an extracellular matrix ecm protein in the [MASK1] famil y and its ligand gicerin is a novel cell adhesion molecule in the

[MASK1] is important for rgc axon growth during development. moreover an important function of [MASK1] surrounding the neuronal cell body and dendrites in regeneration has been suggested. furthermore it has been demon- strated that axons grow predominantly on [MASK1] and the length of axons and the proportion of regenerating neurons varies with the concentration of [MASK1] used for coating. furthermore it has been demon- strated that axons grow predominantly on [MASK1] and the length of axons and the proportion of regenerating neurons varies with the concentration of [MASK1] used for

we found that adult rgcs had a preference for [MASK1] as a substrate. some rgcs that grew very long neurites these were seen most frequently on [MASK1] com- pared to the other substrata studied. no m\u00fcller cells were present in the cul- tures data not shown it is clear that [MASK1] can promote the growth of these long neurites. one provocative hypothesis is that these fast growing cells are the rgcs which during devel- opment cover longer distances from the peripheral retina to the most distal areas of the superior colliculus and that they keep the memory for extending long neurites on [MASK1] as happens during development. the distribution of [MASK1] with- in the pathway is consistent with its localization at the end-feet of neuroepithelial cells that line the route and it continues to be expressed at these marginal sites during early development. at later stages [MASK1] becomes restricted to the basal lamina at the retinal inner limiting mem- brane and the pial surface of the optic pathway. we found that while [MASK1] and fibronectin and to a lesser extend collagens were mainly present. while rgc somas are located in the retina in contact with 1 [MASK1] se- creted

creted by astrocytes and m\u00fcller glia 2 [MASK1] from the m\u00fcller end feet and 3 collagen pres- ent in the vitreous fibrils. this indicates that the integrin most likely involved in the growth of rgcs on [MASK1] is \u03b15\u03b21 and to a lesser extend \u03b13\u03b21. therefore we con- clude that rgcs growing in [MASK1] have activated integrins present which signal through the fak route. for example it has been found that endogenous \u03b12\u03b21 on melanoma cells but not on platelets binds to [MASK1] whereas both cells use \u03b12\u03b21 to bind to collagen. in the present study we were able to show that adult rat rgcs can survive and grow in the pres- ence of different ecm environments [MASK1] collagen i collagen iv and fibronectin. cohen j burne jf winter j bartlett p 1986

[MASK1] promotes connections of corticospinal neurons onto spared descending interneurons in spinal cord injured rats. a combination of [MASK1] and nt-3 promotes supraspinal axonal regeneration into schwann cell grafts in adult rat thoracic spinal cord. other well-characterized neurotrophins include brain- derived neurotrophic factor [MASK1] neurotrophin-3 nt-3 and neurotrophin-45 nt-45 2730. trka is specific for ngf trkb binds both [MASK1] and nt45 and trkc binds nt3 33. [MASK1] activation of trkb as well as the trafficking of this receptor is camp-dependent 36. this is intriguing as ngf and nt-3 have considerably weaker capacity to promote survival or regeneration in retinal ganglion cells 37 while both neurotrophin ligands of trkb [MASK1] and nt-45 demonstrate benefit in both regards 38. additionally priming neurons via pre-treatment with [MASK1] overcomes inhibitory cues in cns myelin in a camp-dependent manner 3940. interestingly these effects mirror the response of neurons pre- treated with exogenous [MASK1] andor camp 1853. a role for sac in the signaling by trkb ligands [MASK1] and nt-45 is also supported for example trafficking and phosphorylation of trkb has been shown to be camp-dependent 3699 and the same intrinsic growth states associated with [MASK1] attraction by growth cones 100 has been shown to increase neuronal survival and regeneration 101. a role for sac in the signaling by trkb ligands [MASK1] and nt-45 is also supported for example trafficking and phosphorylation of trkb has been shown to be camp-dependent 3699 and the same intrinsic growth states associated with [MASK1] attraction by growth cones 100 has been shown to increase neuronal survival and regeneration 101. additionally a novel role for sac has been recently documented in the priming effect of [MASK1] on primary neurons which overcomes inhibition by cns myelin 102. in that paper it was shown that the benefit of [MASK1] pre-treatment was lost when sac function was disrupted via pharmacologic inhibition or genetic silencing. limited [MASK1] contributes to the failure of injury to skin afferents to produce a neuropathic pain condition. in rats [MASK1] transiently increases the outgrowth of regenerating axons from early developing rgcs and has a subtle effect on adult rgc explants avwenagha et al 2003.

[MASK1] did not show such an effect like ngf in this report. it has also been shown that other growth factors such as [MASK1] nt-3 insulin-like growth factor russo et al 1995 fibroblast growth factor

motoneurons receive ample trophic support from them- selves in an autocrineparacrine manner eg [MASK1] fgf-2 or from their immediate environment ie peri- neuronal glial cells or cells of the proximal

motoneurons and we found a decrease in trkb expression to 70 of the contralateral level within the first 7 days after injury kobayashi et al 1997. whereas only 53 of corticospinal neurons sur- vive

this represents the delivery of trophic support di- rectly to the neuronal cell body but the provision of neurotrophic factors such as [MASK1] to the cut axons in the spinal cord either by direct

provide the necessary trophic support necessary to prevent rubrospinal atrophy and in some cases encour- age axonal regeneration. by applying [MASK1] directly to the cell bodies instead of to the spinal cord injury site we found that these chronically injured neurons were indeed still responsive to such trophic support as evidenced by the reversal of their massive atrophy the stimulation of gap-43 and ta-1 tubulin expression and most impor- tantly the promotion of axonal regeneration into pn transplants kwon et al 2002. workers in our laboratory have also observed that injured corticospinal neurons show a similar trophic re- sponse to axotomy after application of [MASK1] to their cell bodies ie up-regulation of gap-43 and ta-1 tubulin. with cell body application of [MASK1] we also failed to promote the regeneration into pn transplants inserted into the dorsal column of the spinal cord but we did observe enhanced sprouting of the severed corticospinal axons within the

level will fill the lesion cavity forming a continuous interface with no evidence of cyst or scar formation and thus provide a bridge through which regenerating axons can grow. the robust regeneration of red nucleus neurons suggests that [MASK1] provided by the modified fibroblasts has improved the intrinsic growth properties of these neurons. the ability of some of the re- generating axons to grow through the graft indicates that the production of [MASK1] makes the fibroblast environment permissive. the grafting of fibroblasts modified to secrete [MASK1] also has rescuing effects on injured neurons that die or atrophy following axotomy liu himes murray tessler and fischer submitted. thus the [MASK1] secreting transplant improved performance and this effect was abolished by a hemisection lesion just rostral to the transplant. significant numbers of cns axons regenerate into guidance chan- nels seeded with schwann cells and grafted into a midthoracic transection site xu guenard

nonneuronal cells. 1992 the neurotrophins [MASK1] nt-3 and ngf display distinct patterns of retrograde ax- onal transport in peripheral and central neurons. emphasis has been placed on the classic neurotrophin family consisting of nerve growth factor ngf [MASK1] [MASK1] neurotrophin-3 nt-3 and neurotrophin-45 nt-45. a continuous infusion of [MASK1] in the dorsal spinal cord rostral to a peripheral nerve graft was shown to promote regeneration of sensory axons from the graft into the dorsal column white matter oudega  hagg 1999. following a mid- thoracic contusion spinal cord lesion continuous high concentrations of [MASK1] infused over a 4 week period into the intrathecal space were found to enhance the growth of chat-positive motor axons at the injury epicentre jakeman et al. functional tests in these rats demonstrated that [MASK1] delivery stimulated hindlimb air-stepping a co-ordinated movement thought to be regulated by interneuronal networks in the lumbar spinal cord referred to as central pattern generators. this suggests that [MASK1] could play a role in reducing the threshold for activation of existing non-injured central pattern generators in the spinal cord

and were grafted directly into the spinal cord in a partial cervical hemisection lesion site. [MASK1]. the effects of [MASK1] on rubrospinal axons were not examined in this study. previous studies involving infusion of [MASK1] into the intrathecal space failed to demonstrate effects on sensory axons bradbury et al. 1995a [MASK1] and nt-3 were both infused into the space around the sc cable inside the panpvc-channel for 14 days. recently it was tested whether adenoviral vector ad- mediated delivery of [MASK1] and nt-3 distal to a sc graft in the completely transected adult rat thoracic spinal cord would promote axonal growth from the graft into the distal cord blits et al. nt-3 but not [MASK1] prevents atrophy and death of axotomized spinal cord projection neurons. fibroblasts genetically modified to express [MASK1] promote regeneration of adult rat rubrospinal axons and recovery of forelimb function. schwann cells genetically modified to secrete human [MASK1] promote enhanced axonal regrowth across transected adult rat spinal cord. a combination of [MASK1] and nt-3 promotes supraspinal axonal regeneration into schwann cell grafts in adult rat thoracic spinal cord. our laboratory has previously demon- strated that after axotomy of the rubrospinal tract at the thoracic level the infusion of [MASK1] [MASK1] or neurotrophin nt-45 into the vicin- ity of the red nucleus resulted in the up-regulation of gap-43 and ta1-tubulin and the promotion of axonal regeneration into peripheral nerve transplants grafted into the injury site65 without this neurotrophic applica- tion to the cell body the rubrospinal neurons fail to express rags after thoracic axotomy and fail to regen- erate into peripheral nerve grafts4364 we have similarly found [MASK1] application to the thoracic axotomy site ineffective at promoting rag expression. our laboratory has previously demon- strated that after axotomy of the rubrospinal tract at the thoracic level the infusion of [MASK1] [MASK1] or neurotrophin nt-45 into the vicin- ity of the red nucleus resulted in the up-regulation of gap-43 and ta1-tubulin and the promotion of axonal regeneration into peripheral nerve transplants grafted into the injury site65 without this neurotrophic applica- tion to the cell body the rubrospinal neurons fail to express rags after thoracic axotomy and fail to regen- erate into peripheral nerve grafts4364 we have similarly found [MASK1] application to the thoracic axotomy site ineffective at promoting rag expression. using an adult rat model in which the dorsal col- umns were crushed bradbury et al17 demonstrated sen- sory axonal regeneration after the intrathecal applica- tion of nt-3 but not with [MASK1]. as in the bradbury et al experiments17 [MASK1] was not found to be effective. in the animal setting neurotrophic delivery by ex vivo gene transfer was demonstrated by liu et al76 who transplanted genet- ically modified fibroblasts producing [MASK1] into a rat cervical hemisection injury model and showed some rubrospinal tract growth and functional recovery in a limb usage test. the discovery of myelin associated glycoprotein by mukhopadhyay et al89 and mckerracher et al79 in 1994 has yielded another important neurite inhibitor whose axonal inhibition has been shown to be surmountable by priming with [MASK1] and glial-derived neurotrophic factor23 the possibility that myelin may contain multiple molecular inhibitors each requiring a specific blocking agent has prompted promising investigation into the promotion of axonal regeneration by immunologically targeting the myelin sheath as a whole3758. in an adult rat transection model schwann cell transplants supplemented with [MASK1] and nt-3 infu- sions were found to increase axonal elongation com- pared with transplants alone141 genetic manipulation  of schwann cells to increase their secretion of neurotro- phic factors such as bdnf80 and ngf131133 has also been demonstrated to improve their promotion of ax- onal growth. at the end of this year an intracranial infusion of [MASK1] for 7 days to the vicin- ity of the rubrospinal nucleus resulted in equal numbers of cells in the injured red nucleus compared with unin- jured suggesting that these neurons are not dying but rather are atrophying so significantly as to become indis- tinguishable from the surrounding glial stroma81 in ad- dition we have observed this cell body neurotrophic ap- plication to be associated with an up-regulation in rags and the promotion of rubrospinal axon regeneration into peripheral nerve transplants even as late as 1 year postinjury73 these results are encouraging for the devel- opment of therapeutic strategies for chronically injured patients but more work is necessary to improve on the delivery of neurotrophic factor to the neuronal cell bod- ies and to integrate cellular transplantation techniques.

[MASK1]. up-regulation of [MASK1] mrna by seizure is found  in a variety of animal models. [MASK1] mrna following elevated neuronal  activity were first documented in ka-induced seizure zafra et al 1990. induction of [MASK1] also follows epilepti- form activity evoked by electrolytic lesions isackson   et al 1991 kindling ernfors et al 1991 bengzon et al 1993 kokaia et al 1994 1996a 1996b  sato  et  al 1996 ferencz et al 1997 hughes et al 1998 simonato et al 1998 and ecs nibuya et al 1995  as well as in several models of chemoconvulsant sei- zure including pilocarpine- schmidt-kastner et al 1996 pentylenetetrazol ptz- humpel et al 1993a 1993b and tetanus toxin-induced events liang et al 1998. elevated [MASK1] mrna expression is also seen  in hippocampal tissue from human epileptic patients murray et al 1994 mathern et al 1997 indicating that this aspect of the animal models is consistent with the human condition. in general up-regulation of [MASK1] mrna occurs quickly increasing as high as 40-fold over control by 3-6 h after seizure initiation zafra et al 1990 bal- larin et al 1991 ernfors et al 1991 gall  et  al  1991a 1991b isackson et al 1991 dugich-djordjevic et al 1992 rocamora et al 1992  gwag  and  springer 1993 humpel et al 1993a 1993b wetmore et al 1994 nibuya  et al 1995 schmidt-kastner  et  al 1996 lee et al 1997 rudge et al 1998 simo- nato et al 1998. both the extent and duration  of [MASK1] induction depend on the type and severity of seizure. 1991 found that [MASK1] levels are dra- matically elevated within hours of the  lesion  but  return to near basal values  in  2-3  days. in  contrast the continuous seizures produced by intracranial ad- ministration of ka last for up to 8-10 h and elevated levels of [MASK1] mrna persist  in  the  dentate  gyrus  for up to 2 weeks following the initial seizure event garcia et al 1997. interestingly in models in which the initiating insult  is placed only in one hemisphere such as  unilateral hilar lesion or kindling elevations in [MASK1] are com- monly observed bilaterally ballarin et al 1991 ern- fors et al 1991 isackson et  al  1991  rocamora  et al 1992 bengzon et al 1993 gwag and springer 1993 kokaia et al 1994. in situ hy- bridization reveals that [MASK1] mrna is elevated first and most strongly in the dentate gyrus with additional signal at early times in the pyramidal cell layers  of areas ca1 and ca3. in several seizure models further up-regulation next appears in areas outside of the hip- pocampus including the neocortical mantle piriform cortex and amygdala although extra-hippocampal [MASK1] expression varies with the model under investi- gation zafra et al 1990 ballarin et al 1991 ernfors. several groups have examined the contribution of specific glutamate receptor subtypes to seizure-induced [MASK1] expression. 1990 found that while kynurenic acid a broad spectrum glutamate receptor antagonist and cnqx a non-nmda-receptor antag- onist effectively prevent the ka-induced increase in [MASK1] mrna levels administration of mk-801 an nmda-specific antagonist has no effect. in contrast bicuculline- induced [MASK1] up-regulation is completely  abolished by mk801 pretreatment zafra et al 1991. similarly increased expression of [MASK1] protein following a  single electrically-induced after-discharge is also inhib- ited by prior administration of mk801 hughes et al 1998. these differences in [MASK1] regulation may be explained by large up to 15-fold variations in the dosages of mk801 hughes et al 1999. it is  also  likely that nmda-mediated [MASK1] expression varies with the model of seizure employed. the cholinergic contribution to seizure-induced [MASK1] expression has also been explored. 1996a 1996b found substantial attenuation  of  basal [MASK1] expression as well as kindling-evoked [MASK1] and ngf up-regulation  in  the  hippocampus  and frontal cortex. 1996a 1996b found substantial attenuation  of  basal [MASK1] expression as well as kindling-evoked [MASK1] and ngf up-regulation  in  the  hippocampus  and frontal cortex. in contrast rapid kindling in this lesion model increases stimulation-evoked [MASK1] ex- pression in the dentate gyrus kokaia et al 1996a. while standard kindling of one stimulation per day is  not adequate to initiate [MASK1]  up-regulation  in lesioned animals fast kindling of 40 stimuli in a period of several hours surpasses this threshold. it  is therefore difficult to clearly separate the effects of stimulation number and frequency from seizure sever- ity in the regulation of [MASK1] expression. the expression of [MASK1] protein is also affected by epileptiform events. elevated [MASK1]  levels  are  reported in the ka rudge et al 1998 hilar lesion nawa et al 1995 unilateral continuous hippocam-. in general up- regulation of [MASK1] protein  occurs  more  slowly  and to a lesser extent than the [MASK1] mrna induction in  the hippocampus. in general up- regulation of [MASK1] protein  occurs  more  slowly  and to a lesser extent than the [MASK1] mrna induction in  the hippocampus. for example the same dose of ka that causes a 15-fold elevation of mrna levels within   6 h increases [MASK1] protein levels three-fold in 24 h rudge et al 1998. the spatial pattern of [MASK1] immunoreactivity  is  similar but not identical to that of its mrna indicating that cellular transport nawa et al 1995 vezzani et al 1999 or internalization from extracellular sources rudge et al 1998 may occur after translation. in addition to  increased  levels  of  [MASK1]  mrna and protein following seizure activity several models reveal a corresponding up-regulation of trkb receptor. this induction follows a similar time  course  and  spatial distribution to that of [MASK1] mrna after sei- zure induced by kindling bengzon et al 1993 merlio et al 1993 hughes et al 1998 ecs nibuya et al 1995 pilocarpine schmidt-kastner et al 1996 or ptz humpel et al 1993a 1993b. following administration of ka they find no change in the level of full length trkb but a significant increase in truncated trkb protein which may be used  to sequester the additional [MASK1] produced after  seizure. while these observations suggest possible roles for [MASK1] in neuronal activity and its aftermath pertur- bation studies are required for further conclusions. several groups have undertaken gain-of-function ex- periments based on infusion of exogenous  [MASK1] during the seizure event. in the kindling model a 7-   day infusion of [MASK1] into  the  hippocampus  during the initial stimulation delays or prevents the develop- ment of the fully kindled state larmet et al 1995 osehobo et al 1996 reibel et al 1996. both after- discharge duration and seizure stage are reduced by treatment with [MASK1]. ence of [MASK1] exposure lasts long after perfusion is completed both seizure intensity and duration are diminished for up to 2 weeks after the end of treat- ment. in this context then it is surprising that exogen- ous [MASK1] enhances cell loss in area ca3 when  administered prior to and during the period of  neur- onal death caused by ka rudge et al 1998. more- over [MASK1] has no effect on ka-induced seizure severity. loss-of-function experiments are better suited to address the role of endogenous [MASK1] in seizures and their sequelae. in mice heterozygous for the  [MASK1]  gene homozygous null mice do not survive to adult- hood kokaia et al. 1999b found that icv infusion of a trkb receptor body the ligand-binding domain of trkb fused to the fc region of human igg reduces [MASK1] availability and delays the development of kindling. as in the [MASK1] heterozygous mice no differences in other seizure parameters such as dur-  ation or threshold are observed. thus endogenous [MASK1] signaling is an important part of the develop- ment of kindling in apparent contradiction to the find- ing that exogenous [MASK1] can prevent kindling. thus endogenous [MASK1] signaling is an important part of the develop- ment of kindling in apparent contradiction to the find- ing that exogenous [MASK1] can prevent kindling. 1999b  propose  that exogenous infusion of high levels of [MASK1] results in reduced trkb expression. it is also possible that  [MASK1] induces distinct signaling cascades at different concentrations. regardless of the explanation these experiments suggest that both endogenous and exogen- ous [MASK1] can impact seizure development. based on its ability to promote axonal growth in  vitro [MASK1] was also suspected to mediate the mossy fiber sprouting that occurs following prolonged or repeated seizures. indeed exogenous [MASK1] enhances both the number and length of axon outgrowth from neonatal rat granule cell explant and dissociated cul- tures patel and mcnamara 1995 lowenstein and arsenault 1996. interestingly  where  examined [MASK1] specifically enhances axonal and not dendritic branching patel and mcnamara 1995. nonetheless slice cultures from the hippocampus of mice lacking [MASK1] show no difference in deafferentation-induced mossy fiber sprouting suggesting that [MASK1] is not essential for this outgrowth bender et al 1998. nonetheless slice cultures from the hippocampus of mice lacking [MASK1] show no difference in deafferentation-induced mossy fiber sprouting suggesting that [MASK1] is not essential for this outgrowth bender et al 1998. 1995 observe  more  mossy fiber sprouting in fully kindled [MASK1] heterozy- gous mice in vivo than in wt controls. in addition application of exogenous [MASK1]  to  wt  animals  during kindling has no effect on later mossy fiber sprouting osehobo et al 1996. thus the evidence to date does not support a role for [MASK1]  in hippocam-  pal mossy fiber sprouting. consistent with its regulation by and effects on sei- zure in animal models elevated [MASK1] mrna and protein has also been reported in brains from human epileptic patients murray et al 1994 mathern et al 1997 takahashi et al 1999. 1997 detect 25-fold  higher  levels of [MASK1] mrna in epileptic brains than in autopsy tissue taken from  control  non-injured  patients confirming a previous report murray et al 1994. in addition elevated [MASK1] protein is observed in tissue resected from patients with intractable epi- lepsy takahashi et al 1999. the relative increase in [MASK1] protein parallels the elevation  of  [MASK1]  mrna both being increased roughly 25-fold over control. the relative increase in [MASK1] protein parallels the elevation  of  [MASK1]  mrna both being increased roughly 25-fold over control. the time course and duration of [MASK1] in- duction cannot easily be determined in the human tis- sue however. thus up-regulation  of [MASK1] is found   in both animal models and human tissue and pertur- bation of endogenous [MASK1] levels indicate that this protein is important in seizure development. thus up-regulation  of [MASK1] is found   in both animal models and human tissue and pertur- bation of endogenous [MASK1] levels indicate that this protein is important in seizure development. the mechanism of this effect is not yet clear nor is the role of [MASK1] in seizure sequelae certain. this effect is specific to nt-3 neither ngf nor [MASK1] expression after kindling is altered by thyroid manipulations. while basal nt-3 mrna expression in the hippocampus is slightly diminished 18-30 in the heterozygous mice this deficit significantly impacts seizure-induced up- regulation of [MASK1] trkb and trkc mrna ex- pressions. in con- trast [MASK1] up-regulation after seizure is enhanced by 130 in the heterozygotes compared to wt controls despite normal expression levels prior to stimulation. thus diminished nt-3 function alters seizure progression as well as the seizure-evoked regulation of [MASK1] and its receptor trkb

regeneration and levels of [MASK1] in an optic nerve crush neurotrauma model. additionally [MASK1] expression was quantified in a separate co- hort by elisa in the retina and optic nerve of injured optic nerve crush sham n  5 li- rtms n  5 and non-injured mice sham n  5 li-rtms n  5 that received daily stimulation as above for 7 days. at 1 week there was no significant difference in [MASK1] levels in the retina or optic nerves between sham and li-rtms in injured or non-injured mice p005. whilst the biological mechanisms of rtms are poorly defined a key molecule up-regulated by both rtms and li-rtms effects is brain derived neurotrophic factor [MASK1]  a powerful and versatile signalling molecule that plays many roles not only in synaptic plasticity but also in promoting neuronal survival and axonal outgrowth. furthermore delivery of exoge- nous [MASK1] either by viral overexpression or injection of recombinant protein showed neuro- protective and neuroregenerative effects in a range of cns injury models. we thus hypothesised that li-rtms may be useful in promoting cell survival andor axonal regenera- tion following brain injury via up-regulation of [MASK1]. we chose this proto- col because we have previously shown that it induces plastic reorganisation and robust up- regulation of [MASK1] expression in the mouse visual cortex superior colliculus   and cerebellum. here we found that li-rtms had no effect on rgc survival or axonal regen- eration and that [MASK1] expression was not up regulated in the retina or optic nerve of non-in- jured and injured mice optic nerve crush. our findings suggest that different brain regions may respond differently to li-rtms in terms of [MASK1] up-regulation and that the therapeutic applications of li-rtms will need to be tested in a range of models in order to establish the scope and limitations of this technique. in cohort 2 n  20 mice received 7 days of stimulation to assess changes in [MASK1] concentrations with or without an optic nerve crush. this protocol was se- lected as it mimics endogenous patterns of electrical activity in the nervous system patent pctau 200700045 and has been shown to up-regulate [MASK1] and

brain regions examined previously visu- al system  cerebellum  li-rtms did not up-regulate [MASK1] levels in either the intact or injured retina or in the optic nerve and this was associated with a lack of pro-survival or pro-regenerative effects following injury. [MASK1] elisa data. daily li-rtms for 1 week does not increase [MASK1] levels in the retina or optic nerve of optic nerve crush or intact mice p005 for all groups see section. histograms show [MASK1] levels as  of sham stimulated group. the cellular mechanisms activated by rtms and li-rtms are poorly understood but one fac- tor that is commonly detected is up-regulation of [MASK1] regardless of the intensity of stimula- tion. our previous work showed that li-rtms using the protocol applied here induces structural plasticity and up-regulates [MASK1] in multiple visual brain centres   and in the lesioned olivocerebellar pathway. however in the present study the same li- rtms protocol delivered directly to the eye did not significantly alter [MASK1] in the retina or. measuring [MASK1] at 1 week therefore maximises the chances of detecting changes because the low survival rate at 2 weeks makes a delayed up-regulation unlikely. a possible explanation for the lack of [MASK1] up-regulation is that the rapid death of rgcs andor complete discontinuity between the retina and brain targets in our model prevented the effects of li-rtms. furthermore our current and previous work suggests that li-rtms may still have a role in the protection and conservation of intact rgcs after trauma as long as these neurons retain the ability to retrogradely transport [MASK1] after injury. makowiecki k harvey a sherrard r rodger j low-intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimula- tion improves abnormal visual cortical circuit topography and upregulates [MASK1] in mice. isenmann s kl\u00f6cker n gravel c b\u00e4hrm m protection of axotomized retinal ganglion cells by adenovi- rally delivered [MASK1] in vivo. adenovirus vector-me- diated in vivo gene transfer of [MASK1] [MASK1] promotes rubrospinal axonal regeneration and functional recovery after complete transection of the adult rat spinal cord. weibel d kreutzberg g schwab m [MASK1] [MASK1] prevents lesion-induced axonal die-back in young rat optic nerve.

[MASK1] had no detectable inhibitory effect on the ability of axons to regenerate. however [MASK1] was found to have additional effects that adversely affected the quality of regeneration. thus although [MASK1] has robust effects on axonal behavior it is nevertheless compatible with axonal regeneration axon navigation and the formation of terminal arbors. [MASK1] is a member of the neurotrophin family originally identified for its role in cell survival during development binder and scharfman 2004. [MASK1] has been found to be a potent protector against ganglion cell death. if [MASK1] is delivered intraocularly by injection or viral vector delivery as many as 50 survive at 2 weeks benowitz and popovich 2011 berry et al 2008 cohen et al 1994 di polo et al 1998 harvey et al 2009 mansour-robaey et al 1994 sawai et al 1996 zhang et al 2005 zhi et al 2005 and this is further enhanced with trk b gene transfer cheng et al 2002. for regeneration and injury research on [MASK1] and other trophic factors has primarily focused on outcome with the goal of achieving the strongest effect such as the greatest cell survival or most regeneration benowitz and popovich 2011 blesch and tuszynski 2009 harvey et al 2009 reeves and keirstead 2012. for [MASK1] there is strong evidence for such side effects. when [MASK1] is given intraocularly these axons retract into the eye and sprout extensively within the retina mansour-robaey et al 1994 sawai et al 1996. this regeneration is completely prevented when [MASK1] is delivered intraocularly even when a minimally damaging microcrush is used. to further explore this issue we asked if [MASK1] might similarly inhibit cns regeneration in a system that normally regenerates spontaneously lee-liu et al 2013 matsukawa et al 2004. also developmental studies have shown that [MASK1] and its receptor trkb are present in the visual system of lower vertebrates cohen-cory and fraser 1994 marshak et al 2007 like they are in mammals cabelli et al 1995 isenmann et al 1999 marler et al 2014 and play similar roles in regulating growth and branching making this a valid model to investigate the effects of [MASK1]. also developmental studies have shown that [MASK1] and its receptor trkb are present in the visual system of lower vertebrates cohen-cory and fraser 1994 marshak et al 2007 like they are in mammals cabelli et al 1995 isenmann et al 1999 marler et al 2014 and play similar roles in regulating growth and branching making this a valid model to investigate the effects of [MASK1]. in this study the optic nerve of the goldfish was crushed and [MASK1] was chronically administered to the retinal ganglion cells during optic nerve regeneration. to also investigate effects of [MASK1] on the dynamic behavior of regenerating axons axons were similarly labeled with dil at 3 weeks and the axons were imaged in the living fish over several hours. in adult rats it has been reported that intraocular [MASK1] and nt45 stimulated optic axons to branch within the retina following optic nerve section cui et al 2003 sawai et al 1996. in short in goldfish [MASK1] had no detectable effect within retina. thus there was 43 times more branching with [MASK1] treatment. in vivo imaging regenerating optic fibers [MASK1] injections. exactly the same injection protocol was used to administer [MASK1] as was used for the vehicle control. gross movement absolute values of growth plus retraction averaged 26 \u03bcm for regenerating optic fibers treated with [MASK1] table 1. in vivo imaging comparison of [MASK1] to vehicle-treated fibers. the data is summarized in table 1 the [MASK1] group differed qualitatively in branching from the vehicle control group. also the number of fibers that showed no net movement during the entire imaging period was much greater in the [MASK1] group. the overall average net translocation was numerically less in the [MASK1] group but this was not significantly different mann whitney rank sum test p  057. this yielded a net positive translocation of 56 \u03bcm for the control growth group and this was significantly greater than the 25 \u03bcm of the [MASK1] group mann whitney rank sum test p  005. thus the effects of [MASK1] were shown only for fibers in the correct mediolateral half of tectum. since regenerating axons also invade the incorrect mediolateral half of tectum becker and cook 1987 cook 1983 olson and meyer 1991 it is possible to ask if [MASK1] has effects on these highly ectopic axons. in the [MASK1] treated fish fourteen ectopic fiber endings were visualized at 3 weeks. thus [MASK1] had comparable effects on ectopic fibers. [MASK1] in early regeneration branching and decreased motility. in contrast 81 of [MASK1]-treated fibers had branches at 3 weeks after nerve crush present study which represents a 9 fold increase in branched fibers caused by exogenous [MASK1]. thus [MASK1] strongly promoted premature branching at ectopic positions within the tectum. [MASK1] also significantly decreased the motility of regenerating fibers both in distance moved and frequency of movement. [MASK1] decreased motility gross movement by 75 and doubled the number of stable epochs for fibers that showed overall growth during the imaging period [MASK1]-treated fibers grew half as much as the controls. thus [MASK1] changed the behavior from one in which growth was the most frequent behavior to one of stability. comparison to [MASK1] effects during development. the effect of [MASK1] during development has been extensively studied most notably in the retinotectal projection of xenopus cohen-cory and fraser 1994 cohen-cory and fraser 1995 hu et al 2005 marshak et al 2007. [MASK1] has been found to increase the number and length of branches of optic axons within tectum conversely blocking [MASK1] or trk signaling decreased branching cohen-cory and fraser 1994 cohen-cory and fraser 1995 marshak et al 2007. [MASK1] has been found to increase the number and length of branches of optic axons within tectum conversely blocking [MASK1] or trk signaling decreased branching cohen-cory and fraser 1994 cohen-cory and fraser 1995 marshak et al 2007. although this would seem to indicate that the effects of [MASK1] in development and regeneration are equivalent there are some salient differences that suggest otherwise. in development effects of [MASK1] were observed when it was applied to the tectum but no effect was found when it was delivered to the retina. in regeneration we saw robust effects with intraocular [MASK1] administration. during development [MASK1] increased the episodes of growth hu et al 2005 lom et al 2002 whereas we found a decrease in growth episodes during regeneration. these divergent findings suggest that [MASK1] may have different effects in the adult than in development. [MASK1] in late regeneration. since exogenous [MASK1] induced extensive ectopic branching and decreased growth rate in early regeneration present study one might expect that it could interfere with the ability of optic axons to grow to their correct target region. delivery of exogenous [MASK1] prevents these rearrangements leaving ectopic connections isenmann et al 1999. similarly delivery of [MASK1] has been shown to interfere with the formation of ocular dominance columns in visual cortex cabelli et al 1995. thus [MASK1] did not inhibit axonal navigation. with [MASK1] treatment most axons had branches in anterior dorsal tectum at 5 weeks regeneration compared to few in the controls which resulted in a 4 fold increase in the number of branches with [MASK1]. with [MASK1] treatment most axons had branches in anterior dorsal tectum at 5 weeks regeneration compared to few in the controls which resulted in a 4 fold increase in the number of branches with [MASK1]. these results are summarized in the diagram shown in figure 7 interestingly for fibers that entered the lateral half of tectum instead of dorsal half no branches were seen in lateral half of tectum in either [MASK1]-treated or vehicle controls even though [MASK1] stimulated ectopic branching in these fibers at 3 weeks. the most important result is that excellent regeneration can be obtained with chronic [MASK1] treatment. [MASK1] is not inherently incompatible with optic nerve regrowth axonal navigation and axonal restructuring which needs to take place for effective regeneration. [MASK1] strongly stimulated early ectopic branching and slowed axonal growth. assuming that a way to use [MASK1] to promote cell survival could be found so that it was compatible with regeneration one solution to the side-effect problem might be to stop bndf treatment once axons have reached their target and begin making synaptic connections. at this point axons would be able to derive [MASK1] from their targets and might not need exogenous [MASK1] to promote cell survival. at this point axons would be able to derive [MASK1] from their targets and might not need exogenous [MASK1] to promote cell survival. why [MASK1] inhibited in situ regeneration in rodents pernet and di polo 2006 but not in the goldfish is not known. it seems unlikely that exogenous [MASK1] is shutting down the growth response of the axotomized ganglion cells since it was associated with extensive axonal sprouting within the retina in rodents mansour-robaey et al 1994 sawai et al 1996 and with upregulation of gap43 and talpha1 tubulin klocker et al 2001 kwon et al 2007. also [MASK1] does not prevent the regeneration of ganglion cell axons into sciatic nerve implants although it appears to reduce growth distance cui et al 2003 mansour- robaey et al 1994. [MASK1] increases nitric oxide in the rodent retina zhang et al 2005 which could conceivably interfere with regeneration. an interesting possibility is that [MASK1] enhances signaling from inhibitory molecules found in the optic nerve of mammals. this might explain why [MASK1] not only prevented regeneration but also stimulated the retraction of axons from the myelinated optic nerve and back to the retina which contains no myelin. thus in goldfish [MASK1] might not be able to enhance the inhibitory signals that stop growth. unlike mammals where [MASK1] completely inhibited optic nerve regeneration pernet and di polo 2006 and instead induced axonal retraction and sprouting within the retina mansour- robaey et al 1994 sawai et al 1996 in goldfish no sprouting of optic axons was seen in the retina. however significant side effects of exogenous [MASK1] that adversely affected the quality of regeneration were also observed. intraocular [MASK1] injections. intravitreal injections were used to deliver [MASK1] or vehicle control solution to the retina. then 1 \u03bcl of [MASK1] solution 200 ng recombinant human bdnfml of teleost ringers 005 dmso and 1 mgml bsa or vehicle control solution teleost ringers with 005 dmso and 1 mgml bsa was injected into the vitreous. the schedule of these injections was rigidly maintained and was the same for both the [MASK1] and vehicle control solutions. typically the [MASK1] and control animals were run together as a cohort where the animals were randomly assigned to their treatment group at the time of the first intraocular injection.

[MASK1] was also quite effective in increasing the numbers of regrowing axons but more so when applied intraocularly. in adult mice two intraocular injections of [MASK1] greatly increase the numbers of rgc axons that have reached the end of a peripheral nerve graft 3 weeks after nerve crush cui and harvey 2000 and a continuous supply via adenoviral transfection of the neurons themselves or of neighboring m\u00fcller glia is even more effective leaver et al 2006 pernet et al 2013. for fgf-2 this perhaps indicates that the response could also be partially mediated by fgfr3 which is present in the rgcs duprey-d\u00edaz et al 2012 for [MASK1] it is not clear what other receptors may be present in this system. however our observation that the neurotrophic cocktail is no more effective than [MASK1] alone in the first case or fgf-2 in the second indicates that there is also some degree of overlap or cross-talk of the signaling pathways so that a single growth factor can saturate the response. [MASK1] is known to activate three signaling pathways in rgcs the janus kinasesignal transducer and activators of transcription jakstat mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pi3 akt signaling pathways park et al 2004 lingor et al 2008 fischer and leibinger 2012 wen et al 2012. it has been suggested that only the jakstat and pi3akt and not the mapk pathways are directly involved in stimulating axon growth m\u00fcller et al 2009 which would account for the strong effect of [MASK1] that we observe but does not explain the effects of fgf-2. we conclude that both [MASK1] and fgf-2 have strong facilitating effects on axon regeneration in the frog optic nerve. [MASK1] promotes the regrowth of retinal ganglion cell axons into murine peripheral nerve grafts. [MASK1] not other trophic factors promotes axonal regeneration of axotomized retinal ganglion cells in adult hamsters. aav-mediated expression of [MASK1] promotes long-term survival and regeneration

stimulate optic axon regrowth. notable among these factors is cytokines such as [MASK1] and lif which appear to enhance retinal ganglion cell rgc survival and axonal regeneration via activation of a jakstat signaling cascade. recombinant rat [MASK1] and mouse il-11 rd systems were reconstituted in pbs with 01 bsapbs and used at 50 pgml 01 bsapbs was used as a control. we suspected that gp130-coupled receptors may medi- ate injury-dependent jakstat activation because il-6-like cytokines like [MASK1] that act through gp130-coupled recep-. the il-6 family of cytokines signal through gp130-coupled re- ceptors  and the il-6 family member [MASK1] has been shown to stimulate rgc axon regrowth in mammals. although a [MASK1] gene has not been identified in zebrafish we found that a variety of il-6-like family member genes were induced in rgcs shortly after optic nerve lesion  a b. these included genes encoding the alternative [MASK1] recep- tor composite ligand clcf1crlf1a  as well as those encoding m17 lif and il-11a. to test whether il-6 family members could stimulate optic axon regeneration we treated retinal explants with recombinant mammalian il-11 or [MASK1]. however regardless of how explants were pre- pared treatment with il-11 alone or in combination with [MASK1] stimulated axonal regrowth cd. even preconditioned explants which normally exhibit robust optic axon outgrowth extended more and longer axons after treatment with il-11 alone or il-11 and [MASK1] in combination cd. interestingly [MASK1] had a more robust effect on axonal growth from explants prepared without a preconditioning nerve lesion than it did on explants with a preconditioned nerve injury d. we also found that il-11 and [MASK1] had an additive effect on axon den- sity but not axon length. although zebrafish do not appear to harbor a [MASK1] encoding gene we were intrigued by the observation that [MASK1] could stimulate optic axon regeneration in retinal explants and that the zebrafish cntfr gene is induced in rgcs after optic nerve injury. although zebrafish do not appear to harbor a [MASK1] encoding gene we were intrigued by the observation that [MASK1] could stimulate optic axon regeneration in retinal explants and that the zebrafish cntfr gene is induced in rgcs after optic nerve injury. recombinant il-11 andor [MASK1] were added as soon as retinas were placed in culture. consistent with the idea that the composite [MASK1] receptor ligand clcf1crlf1a contributes to optic nerve regeneration in zebrafish we found that knockdown of either clcf1 or crlf1a suppressed optic axon regrowth in retinal explants f. because both these ligands act via the [MASK1] receptor its activation may be regulating the number of responding rgcs by increasing their reprogram- ming to a growth-permissive state. although this pathway and optic nerve regeneration can be activated in mammals with [MASK1] or constitutively active stat3 the noted increase in regen- eration is still incomplete and misguided. elson gc lelievre e guillet c chevalier s plun-favreau h froger j suard i de coignac ab delneste y bonnefoy jy gauchat jf gascan h 2000 clf associates with

[MASK1]. 2009 exogenous [MASK1] stimulates axon regeneration of retinal ganglion cells partially via endogenous [MASK1]. when grafting was performed without delay hgf stimulated twice the number of axons to regenerate compared with control but was less potent than [MASK1]. how- ever in pn grafting delayed for 7 days after optic nerve injury hgf maintained a better propensity of ganglion cells to regenerate than [MASK1]. unlike [MASK1] hgf application did not increase hsp27 expression in ganglion cells. on the other hand although [MASK1] stimulates more ganglion cells to regenerate ax- ons into a peripheral nerve graft compared with other trophic factors 2 it only slightly enhances survival 8. thus it becomes imperative to search for other trophic factors that could provide additional beneficial effects for example a longer survival-pro- moting period as well as stimulating regeneration from ganglion cells that are not responsive to [MASK1]. the number of ganglion cells that regenerated axons into a pn grafted to the optic nerve immediately after injury was almost doubled when a single 4 lg hgf intravitreal injection  was given 2245  131 p  001 compared with bsa as compared to bsa control 1214  80 although this magnitude was less than that of [MASK1] 4966  720 which was the most robust trophic factor for ganglion cell regeneration figure 4ab. however the potency of [MASK1] was rapidly lost if pn grafting was delayed for 7 days post-injury the number of ganglion cells that could still regen- erate dropped to 1237  73 this being only 25 of the num- ber stimulated by immediate grafting figure 4a. not significantly different between the [MASK1] and hgf groups when pn grafting was delayed. in fact when pn grafting was delayed the number of ganglion cells  that  could  still respond to and regenerate into the pn  became comparable  in the [MASK1] and hgf groups p  01 figure 4a. that at  7  days  postinjury  both  single  dose  and  multiple  injections of hgf failed to  up-regulate  hsp27  expression  in  ganglion  cells   while [MASK1] treatment led to a drastic increase in ganglion cells expressing hsp27  compared  with  bsa  control. at  14  days  postinjury most groups except [MASK1] had almost no hsp27 cell expression     thus      the      bars      seemed      to      be      missing. similarly [MASK1] only affords mild protection at 7 days post-injury but no longer res- cues ganglion cells at 14 and 28 days post-injury. a previous study has reported that of a multi- tude of growth factors tested only [MASK1] could promote significant ganglion cell axonal regeneration into a pn 2. here we showed that hgf could stimulate twice as many ganglion cell axons to regenerate into a pn graft compared with the bsa control although [MASK1] is still more potent. although rapid neuronal degeneration after injury could account to a certain extent the lost of responsiveness to a growth stimulus this factor could not explain the observed difference in regenerative propensity to the delayed grafting between hgf and [MASK1] since the extent of gan- glion cell survival at 7 days post-injury was similar between them hgf  63  13 vs [MASK1]  597  07 figure 2. although rapid neuronal degeneration after injury could account to a certain extent the lost of responsiveness to a growth stimulus this factor could not explain the

[MASK1] strongly promotes ganglion cell regeneration 23 it is tempting to associate the enhanced hsp27 expression by [MASK1] with mecha- nisms involved in regeneration 41. because [MASK1] strongly promotes ganglion cell regeneration 23 it is tempting to associate the enhanced hsp27 expression by [MASK1] with mecha- nisms involved in regeneration 41. thus it is likely that the up-regulation of stat3 by [MASK1] in ganglion cells leads to the enhanced expression of hsp27 and its phosphorylation which will play a role in pro- moting regeneration whereas hgf will likely utilize downstream targets of the pi3-kakt pathway like mammalian target of rapa-.

induced by a second injury but this effect was lost when the neurotrophic factor treatment was delayed for 14 and 22 weeks after injury suggesting that a time window exists for effective trophic intervention. almost all the cytokines of the il-6 family except [MASK1] are strongly upregulated after nerve injury and expression levels change in non-neuronal cells distal to the lesion as well as in glial cells and even in neurons in drgs and motor pools. schwann cells produce vari- ous kinds of trophic factors and receptors including neurotrophins [MASK1] [MASK1] trans- forming growth factor

[MASK1] fgf-2 and pstat3 expression remain elevated chronically after sci in mice and rats. our previous work showed that [MASK1] and fgf-2 two factors that promote ol formation and survival are elevated for at least 4 wpi along the gliogenic lesion border after sci in rats. to determine whether these factors remain elevated beyond 4 wpi fgf-2 and [MASK1] immunolabeling was performed. naive and 12 wpi mouse spinal cord sections were immu- nolabeled for [MASK1]. minimal [MASK1] immunoreactivity was present in naive tissue as expected d. at 12 wpi [MASK1] immunoreactivity was robust both along the glial scar lesion border e and in spared tissue further from the lesion f.

[MASK1]  administration  onto  autologous pn grafts transplanted within transected on increased regeneration but these effects were significantly reduced after removal of macrophages from this site. in addition the effects of [MASK1] using pn grafts at on transection sites are further subject to debate as previously it has been shown that ad-[MASK1] injections preserved rgc axons but did not induce regeneration of axotomized rgcs. thus other studies have addressed rgc survivability and axonal regeneration with [MASK1] and other growth factors but most trophic factors affect neuronal survival and regeneration differentially. in addition other studies have addressed rgc survivability and axonal regeneration with [MASK1] and other growth factorsbut most trophic factors affect neuronal survival. lentiviral-mediated transfer of [MASK1] to schwann cells within reconstructed peripheral nerve grafts enhances adult retinal ganglion cell survival and axonal regeneration. cooperative effects of bcl-2 and aav-mediated expression of [MASK1] on retinal ganglion cell survival and axonal regeneration in adult transgenic mice. aav-mediated expression of [MASK1] promotes long-term survival and regeneration of adult rat retinal ganglion cells. long-distance axonal regeneration induced by [MASK1] gene transfer is impaired by axonal misguidance in the injured adult optic nerve. adenovirus-mediated expression of [MASK1] [MASK1] rescues axotomized rat retinal ganglion cells but does not support axonal regeneration in vivo.

[MASK1] alone had no detectable effect on regeneration but the combination promoted regeneration as effectively as shpten fig. opn and [MASK1] promoted rgc survival to a modest extent fig. we then tested the relationship of opn [MASK1] and mtor activation as promoters of regeneration.

[MASK1] on its own had no detectable effect of mtor signaling in rgcs following axotomy but expression of opn with or without [MASK1] enhanced mtor signaling following axotomy as it did in normal retina fig. moreover rapamycin a potent and specific inhibitor of mtor laplante and sabatini 2012 blocked axonal regeneration promoted by opn plus [MASK1] fig. stimulatory role of [MASK1] was not unique and opn can promote substantial axon regeneration when paired with growth factors. osteopontin plus [MASK1] promotes selective regeneration of \u03b1rgcs. we expected that administration of opn plus [MASK1] to most or all rgcs would promote regeneration in multiple rgc types. to test this idea we introduced aav-opn and [MASK1] intravitreally in kcng4-yfp hb9-gfp and tyw3 mice to label \u03b1rgcs oodsgcs and w3-rgcs respectively. the result that aav-opn and [MASK1] are insufficient to promote regeneration of other rgc subtypes to which they are delivered implies that \u03b1rgcs differ from non-\u03b1-rgcs in some quality that enhances their regenerative responses following injury. the difference could be in the ability of rgc subtypes to respond to [MASK1] to up-regulate mtor signaling or to respond appropriately to [MASK1]- and mtor-initiated signals. as a first step in distinguishing these alternatives we compared levels of the [MASK1] receptor igf1r in \u03b1rgcs and non-\u03b1rgcs. levels of ps6 fell dramatically in rgcs following axotomy as shown previously park et al 2008 and introduction of shpten or opn plus [MASK1] restored its levels. 90 of ps6-rich rgcs following shpten treatment and 60 of ps6-rgcs following opn plus [MASK1] treatment. 3a levels of praptor paralleled those of ps6 \u03b1rgcs accounted for 90 of praptor-rich rgcs following either shpten treatment or opn plus [MASK1] administration fig. the expression level did not differ detectably between \u03b1rgcs and non-\u03b1rgcs and did not change detectably following shpten treatment or opn plus [MASK1] administrationfig. regeneration promoted by opn plus [MASK1] or shpten is restricted to \u03b1rgcs. second why is regeneration restricted to \u03b1rgcs even when opn plus [MASK1] or shpten is supplied to most rgcs. we suggest that [MASK1] which does not detectably enhance mtor signaling activates the mtor-independent pathway b in fig. sections of optic nerves of kcng4-yfp tyw3 and hb9-gfp mice at 14dpc treated with aav-opn and [MASK1] and injected with ctb at 12dpc. section of optic nerves from kcng4-yfp mice injected with cre-dependent aav-opn plus [MASK1]. sections from mice injected with control vector aav-shpten or aav-opn plus [MASK1]. further genome-wide gene expression analysis from a pure rgc population after conditional deletion of mdm4 showed enhancement of igf1r expression suggesting [MASK1] signal- ling as a downstream effector of the mdm4 deletion. indeed co-inhibition of mdm4 and [MASK1] signalling after optic nerve crush via a speci\ufb01c igf1r antagonist impairs axonal regeneration while viral overexpression of [MASK1] in the eye enhances it. indeed co-inhibition of mdm4 and [MASK1] signalling after optic nerve crush via a speci\ufb01c igf1r antagonist impairs axonal regeneration while viral overexpression of [MASK1] in the eye enhances it. cloning of the aav-2 vector carrying a human [MASK1] cdna sequence was previously described pmid 22160392. in line with igf1r loss of function overexpression of [MASK1] in the eye  6a and b led to enhanced axonal regeneration  6c and d whereas it did not  affect  rgc survival 6e and f. a role for [MASK1] signalling in axonal regeneration down- stream of mdm4. together these data support a novel role for mdm2p53 [MASK1] axis in axonal sprouting and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. the present work de\ufb01nes mdm4-mdm2p53 as a protein complex re- stricting axonal sprouting and regeneration whose disrup- tion activates p53 and the axonal regenerative program via [MASK1] signalling. figure 6 overexpression of [MASK1] promotes axonal regeneration after optic nerve crush. b immunofluorescence micrographs showing high [MASK1] expression level 3 days after optic nerve crush in retinal ganglion cells tuj1 infected with aav-[MASK1] while a faint signal was observed in aav-ctr infected rgcs. figure 8   mdm2p53 inhibition via nutlin-3 delivery enhances 5-htaxonal sprouting and functional recovery via [MASK1] following    t9 dorsal hemisection. jak1 and tyk2 activation by the homologous polycythemia vera jak2 v617f mutation cross-talk with [MASK1] receptor.

[MASK1] level is further reduced in the heterozygous mutants compared to the homozygous mutants even though active mmp-9 expression post-surgery in the heterozygous mutants was not significantly elevated. these findings strengthen the idea that ngr1 antagonism alone may not be sufficient to induce significant improvements following sci but may necessitate combination with other therapeutic measures such as spatial or temporal regulation of glial scar formation or [MASK1] degradation. increased gfap i - l and [MASK1] m - p immunoreacitivty is detected surrounding the injury site arrows in sagittal sections. figure 5 mmp-9 activation [MASK1] degradation and glial scar formation in ngr1 mutant mice. with injury or disease an increase in [MASK1] expression is commonly observed close to lesioned areas. however these [MASK1] deposits form a substantial barrier to regeneration and are largely responsible for the inability to repair damage in the brain and spinal cord. this review discusses the role of cspgs as inhibitors the role of inflammation in stimulating [MASK1] expression near site of injury and therapeutic strategies for overcoming the inhibitory effects of cspgs and creating an environment conducive to nerve regeneration. it is important to understand that upregulation of [MASK1] expression in response to an insult is thought to be a protective mechanism an attempt to wall  off the area of damage and limit its spread 1215. it follows then that one therapeutic approach to enhance cns repair involves modulation of [MASK1] expression which can change the cellular environment to allow for neural regeneration. among the many [MASK1] molecules expressed in the cns are the lectican group which include aggrecan three forms of versican v0 v1 and v2 neurocan and brevican figure 1. neuron-glial antigen 2 ng2 is a unique  [MASK1] that lacks sequence homology to other known  cspgs. it has been demonstrated that a [MASK1] molecule can be either inhibitory or permissive for axonal growth. in the healthy adult nervous system the soma and proximal dendrites of certain neurons are surrounded by a [MASK1] rich structure known as a perineuronal net. in terms of general [MASK1] expression patterns white matter is rich in versican and neurocan while brevican can be found throughout the cns and ng2 is found expressed among meningeal cells blood vessels and opcs 27. stimulating [MASK1] expression. while all members of the [MASK1] family are expressed following a traumatic insult to. [MASK1] deposition at cns lesions. there are many members of the [MASK1] family and individual cspgs are synthesized by different cell types and at different time points following injury. however the temporal pattern in which individual [MASK1] molecules are produced is different. additionally while changes in [MASK1] expression in tissue adjacent to the damaged tissue are well described alterations in cspgs expression in areas distal to lesions are also observed. in a study conducted by andrews and colleagues 105 following a spinal contusion at the t8 level [MASK1] expression was detected in both the lumbar and cervical enlargements far away from the injury site. in neurodegenerative lesions the timeline of [MASK1] expression is not well understood as all histopathology in humans occurs post-mortem. the upregulation of [MASK1] expression has also been discovered in other neurodegenerative diseases such as huntingtons disease ms around the inclusions of parkinsons disease in picks disease and progressive supranuclear palsy 106 107. in other forms of nontraumatic cns injuries such as stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis reactive astrogliosis occurs with [MASK1] deposition as a result of the pathology 110 111. the cytokine and chemokine molecules expressed by these immune cell infiltrates elicit a process of reactive astrogliosis which in turn is responsible for the upregulation of [MASK1] expression. a cytoskeletal regulator being found locally within the growth cone after [MASK1] contact 115. while cspgs are widely accepted to be inhibitory to axonal regeneration the inhibitory nature of individual [MASK1] molecules varies among the proteoglycans. when the opcs processes came into contact with cspgs the cellular process retracted and avoided contact with the [MASK1] rich surface similar to what was observed with neurons. in vivo [MASK1] expression can modulate the migration and differentiation of endogenous opcs that are attracted to cns lesions. activation renders neuronal process outgrowth insensitive to [MASK1] deposits 134. to date there are no definitive reports that ngr1 ngr3 or lar function as [MASK1] receptors in oligodendrocytes. the bacterial enzyme chondroiti- nase abc cabc can neutralize the inhibitory nature of the [MASK1] molecules and thus was tested in many injury models. when tested in an in vivo model of spinal cord injury the slow release of active cabc from nanospheres resulted in a significant increase in the level of [MASK1] digestion at 2 weeks and 1 month after injury when compared to direct injections as well as a significant increase in the level of axonal sprouting throughout the lesion site 157. should [MASK1] turnover occur before axonal outgrowth or remyelination  is complete the newly deposited cspgs would once again create a highly inhibitory influence and halt the regeneration. however there is clearly a need for a balance of [MASK1] degradation and reconstitution. therefore at least the core proteins of cspgs and perhaps the intact [MASK1] molecule may be needed to stabilize the spinal cord environment after cns injury. studies demonstrate that while the  functionalbehavioral recovery is mixed in all cases of cabc administration following tbi or stroke there are signs of anatomical reorga- nization with degradation of the [MASK1] matrix perineuronal nets and evidence of axonal sprouting and growth 145147. when sirna directed against chondroitin polymerizing factor chpf was introduced into astrocytes [MASK1] core proteins were produced but they were not decorated with the gag side chain and did not pose a significant barrier to axonal growth from cerebellar granule neurons 164. modification of cs-gag expression on cspgs while not completely ablating the [MASK1] molecule is a reasonable approach to facilitating repair. while modification of [MASK1] expression is an attractive therapeutic approach there are still many questions which need to be answered. the most important consideration for repair of the damaged cns is that controlling [MASK1] expression is only one aspect of the solution. [MASK1] regulation is but one important step in restoring cns function after injury or disease. b a walker s ji and s r jaffrey intra-axonal translation of rhoa promotes axon growth inhibition by [MASK1] journal of neuroscience vol. accordingly degradation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans [MASK1] by chondroitinase abc promotes a more m2-like macrophage phenotype 15. on [MASK1] untreated rgcs mean neurite length 62658 mm as well as rgcs transduced with aavegfp-shrna 68266 mm exhibited a significant reduction   of   neurite   outgrowth   with   the   mean neurite. completely rescued this growth-inhibiting effect of [MASK1]. figure 2 knockdown of rock2 and limk1 rescues the inhibitory effects of [MASK1] on neurite outgrowth in rgcs. in contrast rgcs transduced with aavrock2-shrna and aavlimk1-shrna are not affected by [MASK1] with regards to their neurite growth. as downregulation of rock2 and limk1 was equally effective in inducing neurite outgrowth of rgcs on [MASK1] and long-  distance regeneration after onc it seems plausible that the specific neurite growth-promoting effect of rock inhibition is mainly mediated via limk1 and its downstream modulation of cofilin and actinthese findings indicate that limk1 might be an interesting therapeutic target for selective regulation of neurite outgrowth. we also tested the neuronal markers th and 5-ht as well as the glial scar marker chondroitin sulfate [MASK1]. the bar graph illustrates that mice having received hl1-on cells showed a higher mean if intensity of th and lower [MASK1] if intensity when compared with hl1-off cells fig. performed the [MASK1] signaling experiments. our previous studies focused on dystrophic growth cones stalled within the [MASK1] gradient that remained active as they recycled membrane9 10 we now report that chronic exposure to [MASK1] can induce the development of a distinct over-adhered morphology with no forward motility fig. our previous studies focused on dystrophic growth cones stalled within the [MASK1] gradient that remained active as they recycled membrane9 10 we now report that chronic exposure to [MASK1] can induce the development of a distinct over-adhered morphology with no forward motility fig. 2d-f12 in ptp\u03c3 null mice only a very minor signal was detected which may reflect nonspecific binding to ptp\u03b4 the third lar family member fig 2d-e17 no detectable binding was observed between isp and other [MASK1] receptors such as lar and ngrs extended data fig. isp treatment allowed adult sensory neurons to extend axons through a [MASK1] gradient in a dose dependent manner to the same extent as pre-treatment with chondroitinase abc chabc which cleaves the glycosylated [MASK1] side chains and removes the ptp\u03c3 ligand fig. isp treatment allowed adult sensory neurons to extend axons through a [MASK1] gradient in a dose dependent manner to the same extent as pre-treatment with chondroitinase abc chabc which cleaves the glycosylated [MASK1] side chains and removes the ptp\u03c3 ligand fig. time-lapse microscopy revealed that while growth cones treated with isp were still transiently collapsed by [MASK1] they continued to reform growth cones allowing them to eventually cross the gradient fig. importantly treatment of adult ptp\u03c3 null sensory neurons with isp did not further increase crossings fig 2j6 in addition mature astrocytes which have immunocytochemically undetectable ptp\u03c318 were unable to traverse the [MASK1] gradient after isp treatment extended data fig 3a. while cspgs have largely been thought to act as repulsive components of the ecm our results suggest that regenerating adult growth cones can become permanently immobilized by [MASK1] gradients.

the [MASK1] core proteins surrounding the site of trauma. while cs56 staining does not increase in regions distant to the injury site there are changes in expression of the [MASK1] core proteins in regions associated with wallerian degenera- tion after dorsal root or cns injuries. pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 tnf\u03b1 and inf\u03b3 promote astrocyte proliferation and several growth factors produced by neu- rons and astrocytes early after injury such as egf tgf\u03b1 and pdgf stimulate proliferation cell migration and [MASK1] production by astrocytes smith and strunz 2005. however the wound healing factor tgf\u03b2 is perhaps the most potent stimulus for [MASK1] synthesis in vitro and its expression in vivo closely correlates with the time course of scar formation after sci. therefore [MASK1] upregulation can be induced by both the very acute pro-inflammatory stimuli associated with immediate secondary injury as well as delayed factors from the recruited cells that drive resolution of the lesion site. in addition in- hibiting [MASK1]-gag expression with deoxyribozyme-medi- ated knockdown of the xylosyltransferase-1 grimpe 2004 or blocking transcription of sox9 which lies upstream of [MASK1] synthesis mckillop et al 2012 also improve the capacity for local axonal sprouting at the lesion site. when administered immedi- ately post-injury the enzyme reduces [MASK1] expression but surprisingly it exacerbated the extent of damage at the lesion site. the authors suggest from these data that early expression of cspgs may limit inflammatory damage while neural plasticity is enhanced in the delay paradigm by blocking [MASK1] production coincident with cellular repair. the enzyme causes increased accumulation of long xyloside-linked gags in the golgi and extracellular matrix that cannot attach to the [MASK1] core proteins carrino and caplan 1994. clearly better approaches are needed to address this time dependent hypothesis using alternative synthesis and processing inhibitors in order to identify the optimal window of intervention for targeting inhibitory [MASK1] sites. recent molecular studies have added s1pr2 as a receptor for the amino terminal domain of nogo-a and have demonstrated shared components for nogo-a and [MASK1] signalling as well as novel nogo antagonists. here activation of intergrins by mn or a specific activating antibody is shown to result in significant neurite outgrowth inspite of the presence of nogo-a or the inhibitory [MASK1] aggrecan. suggests that [MASK1] does accumulate at the lesion where they are detrimental to axon regeneration hu et al 2013. even if it was supposed that in vivo the [MASK1] core proteins do not play a critical role several very recent studies showed that [MASK1] core proteins inhibit neurite outgrowth. even if it was supposed that in vivo the [MASK1] core proteins do not play a critical role several very recent studies showed that [MASK1] core proteins inhibit

regeneration-promoting compound named f050 was noticed in increasing central nervous system neuronal outgrowth when growth was restricted by cspgs. studies have a major goal to underline the correlation between the structural sequences andor overexpression of these [MASK1] and brain disorders. for a better explanation of [MASK1] involvement in cellular processes recent studies used structural and crystallographic methods as well as qsar complementary techniques over the experimental methods such as gwsa. a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying [MASK1] function may facilitate development of new effective therapies to overcome scar-mediated inhibition. previous studies support that cspgs act by non-specifically hindering the binding of matrix molecules to their cell surface receptors through steric interactions but two members of the leukocyte common antigen related lar phosphatase subfamily protein tyrosine phosphatase \u03c3 and lar are functional receptors that bind cspgs with high affinity and mediate [MASK1] inhibition. identification of [MASK1] receptors is not only important for understanding the scar-mediated growth suppression but also for developing novel and selective therapies to promote axon sprouting andor regeneration after cns injuries. astrogliosis axon regeneration cns injury reactive astrocyte scar [MASK1] receptor lar ptp\u03c3 nogo receptor. neurons that express high levels of ecm adhesion receptors such as integrins and low levels of repulsive molecules such as [MASK1] receptors should grow axons readily. phosphacan represents the extracellular domain of transmembrane receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase ptp \u03b2 ng2 a transmembrane [MASK1] exhibits no significant homologies to other proteins. thus surmounting strong suppression of [MASK1] inhibitors in glial scar is a major target for therapeutic intervention following cns injuries. although [MASK1] core proteins are inhibitory by

[MASK1] upregulation also controls the properties of opcs and remyelination after cns injury siebert and osterhout 2011. prior to identification of functional [MASK1] receptors several mechanisms for [MASK1] inhibition of axonal growth had been suggested. prior to identification of functional [MASK1] receptors several mechanisms for [MASK1] inhibition of axonal growth had been suggested. through their highly charged gag moieties cspgs can interact with ecm molecules and suppress neurite growth by attenuating integrin activation and conversely high levels of integrins can surmount [MASK1] inhibition of neurite growth afshari et al 2010 condic et al 1999 tan et al 2011. could partly regenerate on high amounts of [MASK1] probably due to high expression of growth-associated protein-43 andor \u03b21 integrin. the [MASK1] binding may convert sema5a from an attractive to an inhibitory guidance cue kantor et al 2004. inhibition of cspgs on neuronal regeneration and plasticity has been known for over two decades mckeon et al 1991 snow et al 1990 snow et al 1991 but the molecular mechanisms for [MASK1] function are not well understood. sulfation pattern of gag chains is important for [MASK1] inhibition since preventing gag sulfation eliminates much of the inhibitory activity on axon growth in vitro gilbert et al 2005 sherman and back 2008 wang et al 2008. although cspgs may non-specifically hinder binding of matrix molecules to their cell surface receptors through steric interactions recent studies indicate that two members of the leukocyte common antigen-related lar phosphatase subfamily the transmembrane proteins of ptp\u03c3 and lar phosphatase are functional receptors that bind cspgs with high affinity and mediate [MASK1] inhibitory effects fig. ptp\u03c3 mediates [MASK1] inhibition of axonal growthptp\u03c3 has been reported to be one of the functional receptors for cspgs shen et al 2009. [MASK1] neurocan binds and interacts with ptp\u03c3 through [MASK1] gag chains and a number of positively-charged amino acids in the first ig-like domain of ptp\u03c3 aricescu et al 2002 shen et al 2009.

[MASK1] stimulation activates lar phosphatase in vitro fisher et al 2011. thus lar is essential for mediating [MASK1] inhibition as a functional receptor and lar blockade improves axonal growth and behavioral recovery in adult rodents with sci. more recent studies further support the role of ptp\u03c3 and lar in mediating [MASK1] function. newly-generated neurons from neuronal restricted precursors express low levels of ptp\u03c3 and lar proteins and are intrinsically insensitive to [MASK1] substrates. secreted factors by cultured neuronal and glial restricted precursors reduce [MASK1] inhibition and promote axonal growth in vitro ketschek et al 2012. both [MASK1] receptors ptp\u03c3 and lar are selectively expressed in the bad-regenerating neurons and have overlapping cellular distributions suggesting potential link between [MASK1] receptors and poor intrinsic regenerative ability of bad-regenerating neurons in non-mammals zhang et al 2013. both [MASK1] receptors ptp\u03c3 and lar are selectively expressed in the bad-regenerating neurons and have overlapping cellular distributions suggesting potential link between [MASK1] receptors and poor intrinsic regenerative ability of bad-regenerating neurons in non-mammals zhang et al 2013. other receptors that mediate [MASK1] suppression. ngr1 and ngr3 appear to bind [MASK1] gags and mediate [MASK1] inhibition on neuronal growth dickendesher et al 2012. ngr1 and ngr3 appear to bind [MASK1] gags and mediate [MASK1] inhibition on neuronal growth dickendesher et al 2012. combined deletion of ngr1 and ngr3 but not ngr1 and ngr2 overcame [MASK1] inhibition and enhanced regeneration of injured optic nerves in double knockout mice. thus ngr1 and ngr3 may function as [MASK1] receptors and mediate some suppression by two completely different groups of inhibitors generated by oligodendrocytes and reactive astrocytes. several intracellular signals have been implicated to mediate [MASK1] inhibition on neuronal growth including akt glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 gsk-3\u03b2 rhoa protein kinase c pkc and others fig. ptp\u03c3 and lar bind [MASK1] with high affinity as the [MASK1] receptors fisher et al 2011 shen et al 2009 but their downstream signaling pathways to mediate neuron growth failure are less clear. ptp\u03c3 and lar bind [MASK1] with high affinity as the [MASK1] receptors fisher et al 2011 shen et al 2009 but their downstream signaling pathways to mediate neuron growth failure are less clear. [MASK1] stimulation induced significant reduction of phosphorylated akt at ser473 and enhancements of active rhoa signals in neurons derived from lar  mice but did not result in significant changes of these signaling proteins in lar -- neurons. in contrast [MASK1] incubation failed to cause significant alteration of phosphorylated crmp2 at thr514 in neurons cultured from either lar  or -- mice. local translation of rhoa in axons appears to contribute to [MASK1] inhibition walker et al 2012. myosin ii an atp-dependent motor protein appears to mediate [MASK1] inhibition on neuronal growth hur et al 2011 yu et al 2012. it is likely that ptp\u03c3 and lar share certain pathways to mediate [MASK1] function. [MASK1] inhibition and axon regeneration. recent identification of [MASK1] receptors and better understanding of signaling pathways activated by cspgs may help make sense of the myriad cell-autonomous factors previously ascribed roles in axon growth and develop therapies to promote neural repair and functional recovery after cns injury. chabc treatment upregulated tissue plasminogen activator tpa and plasmin around lesioned spinal cord and contributed to neuronal plasticity by degrading [MASK1] core proteins bukhari et al 2011. numerous experiments indicate that [MASK1] digestion with chabc at

intracellular signaling pathways. peptide antagonists for lar receptor reduced [MASK1] inhibition in vitro and subcutaneous administration of these peptides at a post-trauma time frame increased

contrast to the highly invasive approach of applying chabc locally. given that multiple factors contribute to repair failure after cns injury combining [MASK1] receptor blockade with other strategies such as cell transplants is likely to be more effective. in addition gsk-3\u03b2 signal partially mediates [MASK1] inhibition on neuronal growth and. gsk-3\u03b2 suppression overcomes [MASK1]

[MASK1] molecules or is there other unidentified crucial receptors. do [MASK1] receptors regulate functions of glial cells. further illumination of the mechanisms by which [MASK1] acts is extremely

both beneficial and destructive properties in injured tissue. although [MASK1] can induce the m2 phenotype switch during acute phases of sci it is a major component of scar tissue and known to hinder axonal regeneration58 caution against eliciting poorly timed m1-to-m2 phenotype switches in the clinic is also advisable because additional beneficial roles for m1 microglia may yet be discovered. because chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans [MASK1] secreted by scar-forming astrocytes are chemically repulsive and mechanically impenetrable growth inhibitors we investigated post-lesional neurocan secretion in relacnsko mice. mechanistically the enhanced regeneration in relaastko mice correlated with a  diminished  production  of [MASK1] at the lesion site suggesting that the loss of rela from

however many investigators have reported regenerating spinal tracts without eliminating nogo glial scar or [MASK1]. the third theory emphasizes the role of chrondroitin sulfate proteoglycan [MASK1] in stop- ping axon growth. neither glial scars nor [MASK1] necessarily stop axonal growth. many investigators have reported axons growing through dense fibrotic glial scars surrounded by [MASK1] and white matter suggesting that nogo gliosis and [MASK1] do not stop axon regeneration in many situations. many investigators have reported axons growing through dense fibrotic glial scars surrounded by [MASK1] and white matter suggesting that nogo gliosis and [MASK1] do not stop axon regeneration in many situations. nogo and [MASK1] are among several extrinsic factors that inhibit axonal growth via

shown to reduce [MASK1] effectively in vitro fichard et al 1991. with chondroitinase abc the glycosaminoglycan side chains of [MASK1] can be digested while leaving the core protein intact. in vivo

[MASK1] family and the ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf family. ing the structure of the ligand-receptor complex and the mechanism of retrograde transport of the neurotrophins are discussed in detail and compared to information available on the [MASK1] and cntf families. each neu- rotrophic factor family i e ngf [MASK1] and cntf has a set of receptors with specificity for individual members of the

axon guidance experiments were sufficient for a biological response when chemically immobilized netrin was immobilized in a random non-gradient-forming method by edc and nhs onto laminin-coated scaffolds. when compared to rgcs cultured on laminin-coated scaffolds which had been incubated in the [MASK1] solution without first being activated by edc and nhs figure 2a rgcs cultured on these chemically immobilized scaffolds figure 2b demonstrated an increase in the number of polarized rgcs ie cells extending only a single axon figure 2c. in addition rgcs cultured on these scaffolds extended shorter axons owing to the combination of [MASK1] on laminin becoming a repulsive guidance cue. these results establish that the concentration of immobilized [MASK1] was sufficient to elicit a biological response. 24 the fraction of [MASK1] which reacted with the uv-crosslinker was immobilized onto fibronectin-coated pla scaffolds. the gradient was visualized through immunostaining and quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 05 mm intervals from the scaffold center taking intensity measurements at 448 nm for [MASK1] labeling and at 546 nm for autofluorescence to normalize the [MASK1] concentration to the number of fibers at each position. the gradient was visualized through immunostaining and quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 05 mm

[MASK1] labeling away from the high fiber density central point of the scaffold figure 4. thus using this filter and crosslinker approach we were able to generate a gradient of [MASK1] on the scaffolds. with this [MASK1] gradient on the scaffold we next asked whether we could increase the percentage of rgcs extending axons toward the scaffold center. purified rgcs were seeded and following two days of growth samples with and without immobilized [MASK1] were fixed and immunostained for \u03b2-tubulin a marker for rgc neurite growth. in contrast rgcs cultured on scaffolds with immobilized [MASK1] gradients demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the percentage of axons growing along the gradient toward the scaffold center and a decrease in cells with axons growing away from the center and in cells extending axons in both directions figure 5. however rgc axons on both control and [MASK1] immobilized scaffolds did not enter or cross the central point of the scaffold fig 5c 5f. thus culturing rgcs on electrospun scaffolds with a [MASK1] gradient increased the percentage of cells extending an axon toward but not crossing the scaffold center mimicking the centripetal axon growth observed in the retina in vivo. here to mimic the in vivo guidance of rgc axons a [MASK1] gradient was immobilized onto the scaffold surface in order to polarize the outgrowth of the seeded rgcs. [MASK1] was chosen for these first experiments because it can guide rgc axons without the need for other guidance factors9 and because [MASK1] continues to be expressed at the optic nerve head and is partly responsible for the entrance of rgcs into the optic nerve.

[MASK1] has been reported to be a key intracellular mediator of repulsive signaling from surrounding glia cells on the growing axon. downregulation of [MASK1] promotes axonal regeneration after optic

inhibitory to the regeneration of all axons other receptors must be present on the neurons that lack ngr. although first identified as a receptor for nogo-66 ngr also appears to be a functional

[MASK1] much more strongly than granule cells whereas ngr is more strongly expressed by granule cells. thus in cns neurons nogo-66 and [MASK1] expression corre- lates even better with their ability to respond to in-1 than does ngr expression although ngr is a major receptor for oligodendrocyte nogo. if this is the case it would be interesting to see if in-1 binds [MASK1] which is also expressed by cortical neurons. certainly if ngr were the only receptor for nogo mag and [MASK1] interfering with ngr sig- nalling would be likely to have more marked effects than the removal of individual ligands. the nogo and [MASK1] expressed by neurons may also be released into injury sites and may be expressed by axons at the borders of lesion although there is little evidence on this matter as yet. finally

[MASK1] is a lipid phosphatase that converts phosphatidylinositol 345- triphosphate pip3 to pip2 and thus inhibits the activation of downstream effectors of pi3k. deletion of [MASK1] or tsc therefore results in constitutive aberrant activation of mtorc1 thereby playing a central role in tumorigenesis metabolic diseases and neurological disorders1314. in contrast to s6k1 activation inhibition of 4e-bp is not sufficient for axon regeneration but it is necessary for [MASK1] deletion-induced axon regeneration. the dual role of s6k1 in [MASK1] ko-induced on regeneration. to directly investigate the role of s6k1 in [MASK1] deletion-induced axon regeneration we blocked s6k1 activity by intravitreal injection of aav-s6k1-dnaav-cre in [MASK1] floxed mice. to directly investigate the role of s6k1 in [MASK1] deletion-induced axon regeneration we blocked s6k1 activity by intravitreal injection of aav-s6k1-dnaav-cre in [MASK1] floxed mice. compared to the very low activity of mtorc1s6k low ps6 level in adult wt mice and the moderate increase in ps6 level after [MASK1] deletion s6k1-dn significantly reduced ps6 levels in [MASK1] ko mice supplementary fig. compared to the very low activity of mtorc1s6k low ps6 level in adult wt mice and the moderate increase in ps6 level after [MASK1] deletion s6k1-dn significantly reduced ps6 levels in [MASK1] ko mice supplementary fig. 5 and axon regeneration in [MASK1] ko mice fig. 4ab indicating that the [MASK1] ko effect depends at least partially on s6k1 activity. we also co-injected aav- s6k1-caaav-cre in [MASK1] floxed mice and detected an increased ps6 level supplementary fig. we were surprised to find however that rather than increasing rgc survival or axon regeneration s6k1 over-activation in [MASK1] ko mice did not increase rgc survival supplementary fig. these findings suggest that s6k1 activation also plays an inhibitory role in the regeneration induced by [MASK1] ko. consistent with its action in this system levels of phosphorylated akt pakt were lower in [MASK1] ko mice after s6k1-ca injection fig. it inhibits [MASK1] deletion-induced axon regeneration through feedback inhibition of the pi3k pathway. 4e-bp inhibition is required for [MASK1] ko-induced on regeneration. although 4e-bp ko does not allow axon regeneration we evaluated whether phosphorylationinhibition of 4e-bp is required for axon regeneration in [MASK1] ko mice. in the same cohorts of [MASK1] floxed mice injected with aav- cre diluted 11 with pbs or aav-creaav-4e-bp1-4a on regeneration was significantly reduced in the eyes with 4e-bp1-4a expression fig. 4ab indicating the 4e- bp phosphorylationinhibition by mtorc1 is necessary for [MASK1] ko-induced axon regeneration. the amount of axon regeneration induced by s6k1 was much smaller than that of [MASK1] deletion suggesting that s6k1 activation mediates only part of the effect of [MASK1] ko. the amount of axon regeneration induced by s6k1 was much smaller than that of [MASK1] deletion suggesting that s6k1 activation mediates only part of the effect of [MASK1] ko. the additive effect of s6k1 and socs3 further supports the notion that s6k1 is involved in the axon regeneration induced by [MASK1] deletion. thus an explanation for the unexpected inhibitory effect of s6k1 activation on axon regeneration may be that the increased s6k1 activity after s6k1-ca expression reduces pi3k-akt signaling in [MASK1] ko mice and therefore inhibits pi3k-dependent and s6k1-independent axon regeneration. the decreased pakt levels observed in [MASK1] ko rgcs after s6k1-ca expression. this mechanism higher mtorc1s6k1 activity inhibiting pi3k-akt signaling might also account for the smaller amount of axon regeneration in tsc1 ko mice since s6k1 activity is much higher in tsc1 ko mice than in [MASK1] ko mice6. 4e-bp inhibition alone did not allow axon regeneration and together with s6k1 activation only partially reproduced the axon regeneration induced by [MASK1] komtorc1 activation suggesting that other substrates of mtorc14445 or other effectors of [MASK1] may also contribute to axon regrowth fig. 4e-bp inhibition alone did not allow axon regeneration and together with s6k1 activation only partially reproduced the axon regeneration induced by [MASK1] komtorc1 activation suggesting that other substrates of mtorc14445 or other effectors of [MASK1] may also contribute to axon regrowth fig. the significant reduction in axon regeneration in [MASK1] ko mice after overexpression of constitutively active 4e-bp 4e-bp1-4a however indicates the necessity of 4e-bp phosphorylationinhibition downstream of mtorc1 for axon regeneration either through its specific translational targets or through other unknown mechanisms.

[MASK1] is expressed during development but not in mature central nervous system cns neurons. for example [MASK1] normally inhibits the aktmtor pathway 565 which stimulates axonal growth. 349 reported that deletion of the [MASK1] gene enhances regeneration of the cst in rats allowing large numbers of injured cst axons to grow beyond the injury site for the first time. [MASK1] deletion stimulates corticospinal tract growth through the aktmtor pathway. 442 [MASK1] affects aktmtor through the following steps. [MASK1] catalyzes the conversion of pip3 to pip2. when [MASK1] is knocked out or silenced pip3 accumulates and activates akt through phosphoinositide dependent pro- tein kinase-1 and 2 pdpk12. therefore deleting or silenc- ing [MASK1] turns on mtor to stimulate cell growth. mice lacking pdpk1 die dur- ing embryonic development while pdpk1-deficient mice are small but resistant to hyperactivation of pi3k pathway induced by partial deletion of [MASK1] 404. thus akt activation by growth factors [MASK1] suppression or lithium converts the cell from a storage mode to a growth mode. suppression of [MASK1] and activation of the pi3kakt mtor pathway is an established oncogenic driver 438. deletion of [MASK1] induces many types of cancers includ- ing human liver cancer 79 bladder cancer 93 prostate cancer 3489635 glioblastoma 152539 gastric and. indeed [MASK1] mutations are among the most frequently found genetic changes associated with cancer 471. therapies that suppress [MASK1] therefore must be cautiously applied to avoid tumorigenesis and cellular overgrowth. if pos- sible the [MASK1] suppression therapy should be restricted to only the cells that need to be regrown. figure 1  interacting pathways for [MASK1] camp and gsk3b. [MASK1] phosphatase and tensin homolog catalyzes conversion of pip3 phosphoinositol phosphatase 3 to pip2 phosphoinositol phase 2. thus silencing [MASK1] results in pip3 accumulation which activates akt through pdpk1.

[MASK1] mutations 471. these effects of [MASK1] loss result from activation of the aktmtors6k pathways and inactivation of gsk3b and can be partly blocked by pharmacological inhibition of mtor 438. 286 recently described a novel conditional [MASK1] knock- out mouse nex-[MASK1] in which cre under the control of nex promoter drives [MASK1] deletion in early postmitotic excitatory neurons in the developing forebrain. 286 recently described a novel conditional [MASK1] knock- out mouse nex-[MASK1] in which cre under the control of nex promoter drives [MASK1] deletion in early postmitotic excitatory neurons in the developing forebrain. 646 used rna-silencing treatment adeno-associated virus short hairpin [MASK1] aav-shpten to shut down [MASK1] and found massive. 646 used rna-silencing treatment adeno-associated virus short hairpin [MASK1] aav-shpten to shut down [MASK1] and found massive. they showed that ani- mals that have silenced [MASK1] are able to grow through fibronectin-expressing fibroblasts and cd68-positive macrophages 647. spinal cords regenerate after treatment with camp and schwann cells 164448457 lithium 126618 or [MASK1] deletion 349646. 646 described growth of axons across hemisection sites after [MASK1] deletion finding that axons avoided dense clusters of fibroblasts and macrophages but crossed the lesion sites across bridge-forming astro- cytes that express mature markers such as gfap. 646 showed silencing a single gene that is [MASK1] can result in massive regeneration of corticospinal tract in rats not only across in the injury site but through white matter to form synapses without substantial reductions of the glial scar. in fact [MASK1] inhibitors can be applied late after stroke 375 or to peripheral nerves after injury to improve regeneration and recovery of function. [MASK1] would appear to be one such regulatory mechanism. thus for example it would be of interest to determine when [MASK1] expres- sion first appears in the different systems of the body not only during development and during evolution. for example the recent discovery that genetic deletion of [MASK1] allowed massive growth of corticospinal axons across glial scars and grow long distances in white matter raised questions whether nogo or glial scars are neces- sary or sufficient to stop spinal cord regeneration. agarwal v campbell a beaumont k l cawkwell l lind m j [MASK1] protein expression in malignant pleu- ral mesothelioma. backman s a stambolic v suzuki a haight j elia a pretorius j tsao m-s shannon p bolon b ivy g o mak t w deletion of [MASK1] in mouse brain causes seizures ataxia and defects in soma size resem- bling lhermitte-duclos disease. boosani c s agrawal d k [MASK1] modulators a pat- ent review. conley-lacomb m k saliganan a kandagatla p chen y q cher m l chinni s r [MASK1] loss medi- ated akt activation promotes prostate tumor growth and metastasis via cxcl12cxcr4 signaling. cordes i kluth m zygis d rink m chun f eichelberg c dahlem r fisch m hoppner w wagner w doh o terracciano l simon r wilczak w sauter g minner s [MASK1] deletions are related to disease progression and unfavourable prognosis in early bladder cancer. 412175181 1979 fan x aalto y sanko s g knuutila s klatzmann d castresana j s genetic profile [MASK1] mutation and therapeutic role of [MASK1] in glioblastomas. 412175181 1979 fan x aalto y sanko s g knuutila s klatzmann d castresana j s genetic profile [MASK1] mutation and therapeutic role of [MASK1] in glioblastomas. c torok n j de vere white r w farnham p j zern m human esc self-renewal promoting micrornas induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocytes by controlling the [MASK1] and tgfbeta tumor suppressor sig- naling pathways. kazdoba t m sunnen c n crowell b lee g h anderson a e darcangelo g development and char- acterization of nex- [MASK1] a novel forebrain excitatory neuron-specific knockout mouse. a transient silencing of [MASK1] in human cd34 cells enhances their proliferative potential and ability to engraft immunodeficient mice. l f [MASK1] regulates neuronal arborization and social inter- action in mice. akt-mediated reduction in [MASK1] expression contributes to tyrphostin resistance and is reversed by mtor inhi- bition in endometrial cancer cells. liu k lu y lee j k samara r willenberg r sears-kraxberger i tedeschi a park k k jin d cai b xu b connolly l steward o zheng b he z [MASK1] deletion enhances the regenerative ability of adult corticospinal neurons. mao l jia j zhou x xiao y wang y mao x zhen x guan y alkayed n j cheng j delayed administration of a [MASK1] inhibitor bpv improves func- tional recovery after experimental stroke. 131012281233 2007 mihai c bao s lai j p ghadiali s n knoell d l [MASK1] inhibition improves wound healing in lung epithe- lia through changes in cellular mechanics that enhance migration. park k k liu k hu y kanter j l he z [MASK1]. rodriguez-escudero i oliver m d andres-pons a molina m cid v j pulido r a comprehensive functional analysis of [MASK1] mutations implications in tumor- and autism-related syndromes. b l [MASK1] controls beta-cell regeneration in aged mice by regulating cell cycle inhibitor p16ink4a. zhang w hubbard a brunhoeber p wang y tang l automated multiplexing quantum dots in situ hybridization assay for simultaneous detection of erg and [MASK1] gene status in prostate cancer. z short hairpin rna against [MASK1] enhances regenera- tive growth of corticospinal tract axons after spinal cord injury. first study  was done by knocking down [MASK1] and socs3 together with ciliary neurotrophic factor injec- tion. sustained axon regeneration induced by co-deletion of [MASK1] and socs3. [MASK1] antagonist peptide spinal cord injury intrinsic growth capacity axon regeneration functional recovery. [MASK1] appears to be particularly important for controlling the regenerative capacity of injured axons 15. conditional deletion of [MASK1] a negative regulator of mtor remarkably enhanced axon growth after sci or optic nerve injury and protected retinal ganglion cells rgcs from death following axotomy 12 14 16. deletion of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 tsc1 a negative regulator of mtor also activated mtor and enhanced axon regeneration principally by mimicking the effect of [MASK1] deficiency 12. [MASK1] deletion or inhibition has been reported to stimulate axon growth of several neuronal populations including rgcs dorsal root ganglion drg sensory neurons corticospinal tract cst and other motor neurons 12 14 15 17 18. in addition [MASK1] blockade with the general phosphatase inhibitor bisperoxovanadium bpv protected spinal cord tissues after sci 19 20. while suppressing [MASK1] activity is very promising for promoting cns axon regeneration the transgenic approach used in previous studies is not feasible for treating patients. application of bpv may block [MASK1] function 17 but bpv compounds also target many other enzymes 21 and may cause clinical side effects such as lowering blood glucose by activating insulin signaling 22. therefore it is important to develop a pharmacological method to suppress [MASK1] activity efficiently and selectively. in the present study we designed small peptides to block the critical domains of [MASK1] and tested their ability to inhibit [MASK1] signaling stimulate axon growth in vitro and in vivo and promote recovery of locomotor function in adult rodents with sci. in the present study we designed small peptides to block the critical domains of [MASK1] and tested their ability to inhibit [MASK1] signaling stimulate axon growth in vitro and in vivo and promote recovery of locomotor function in adult rodents with sci. design and preparation of [MASK1] antagonist peptides. [MASK1] protein consists of 403 amino acid residues and multiple activity domains including the phosphatidylinositol-45-bisphosphate pip2. the pip2 binding motif at the n-terminus serves a dual role of localizing [MASK1] to the membrane and regulating its activity 24. the atp-binding motifs associate [MASK1] subcellular localization and its tumor-suppressor activity 25 26. the c-terminal tail contains the pdz domain-binding sequence and multiple phosphorylation sites and contributes to [MASK1] stabilization and targeting for phosphorylation by microtubule- associated serinethreonine kinases 27 28. to selectively block [MASK1] function with a pharmacological approach we designed five [MASK1] antagonist peptides pap1-5 by targeting the pip2 atp-type a or b pdz and c-terminal tail regions of [MASK1] fig. to selectively block [MASK1] function with a pharmacological approach we designed five [MASK1] antagonist peptides pap1-5 by targeting the pip2 atp-type a or b pdz and c-terminal tail regions of [MASK1] fig. to selectively block [MASK1] function with a pharmacological approach we designed five [MASK1] antagonist peptides pap1-5 by targeting the pip2 atp-type a or b pdz and c-terminal tail regions of [MASK1] fig. all the [MASK1] antagonist peptides and a random sequence peptide rp control peptide were designed in our lab and synthesized by chi scientific inc maynard ma. antibodies against the following proteins were used [MASK1] 138g6 rabbit mab phospho- akt ser473 587f11 11000 mouse mab akt pan 11e7 1000 rabbit mab phospho- glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 gsk-3\u03b2 ser9 11000 gsk-3\u03b2 27c10 11000 rabbit mab phospho-s6 ribosomal protein ser235236 12000 for western blots rabbit mab phospho-erk12 p4442 12000 cell signaling technology 5-ht serotonin rabbit 14000 immunostar monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap 1400 sigma neuron-specific class iii \u03b2-tubulin tuj1 1400 covance  mouse myelin basic protein mbp smi 99 1400 convence and goat anti-biotin agarose vector lab. the [MASK1] plasmid was purchased from addgene cat 10750 and amplified in our lab. to determine cellular distribution of [MASK1] we stained drgs with anti-[MASK1] and anti-tuj1 antibodies in selected cultures. [MASK1] peptide binding assay in cos-7 cells. forty-eight hrs after transfection with [MASK1] dna or a control plasmid dna that does not express a gene product cells were incubated with purified biotinylated rp or paps 1-4 15 \u00b5m for 1 hour. to detect the potential changes of [MASK1] signaling pathway in vivo we performed a dorsal over-hemitransection injury at t7 see below in two sets of mouse experiments and examined several signaling proteins in the spinal cord or in the brain with western blots. to examine expression changes of [MASK1] p-s6 and p-erk at different time points we performed sci in 5 groups of adult c57bl6 mice 3 mice per group fig. to evaluate potential role of paps in blocking [MASK1] signaling pathway in vivo we made a dorsal transection injury at t7 in 5 separate groups of adult c57bl6 mice fig. to evaluate the role of paps in blocking the [MASK1] signaling pathway in vivo beginning one day after injury mice were injected subcutaneously with rp pap1 pap2 pap3 or pap4 71 \u00b5gmouseday 2 times per day for two days.

[MASK1] expression and s6 and erk activity in the injured spinal cord. to determine whether spinal cord trauma caused a change in expression of [MASK1] protein and its downstream signaling pathway we examined the levels of [MASK1] p-s6 and p-erk in the lesioned spinal cord 121 days after injury. to determine whether spinal cord trauma caused a change in expression of [MASK1] protein and its downstream signaling pathway we examined the levels of [MASK1] p-s6 and p-erk in the lesioned spinal cord 121 days after injury. we detected enhanced [MASK1] expression in the rostral spinal cord 37 days after sci although [MASK1] in the lesion center area was moderately reduced fig. we detected enhanced [MASK1] expression in the rostral spinal cord 37 days after sci although [MASK1] in the lesion center area was moderately reduced fig. also [MASK1] appears to prevent erk activation in neurons 37. thus we monitored alterations of p-s6 and p-erk in the lesioned spinal cord in addition to [MASK1]. these findings suggest inactivation of [MASK1] and activation of mtor several days after sci. to validate biological activity of paps1-4 in vivo we examined the downstream signaling changes of [MASK1] in injured spinal cord following systemic pap treatments. akt gsk-3\u03b2 and s6 are the best-characterized downstream signals of [MASK1] and measurement of phosphorylated akt gsk-3\u03b2 and s6 is widely used to determine [MASK1] and mtor activities 12 38 39. akt gsk-3\u03b2 and s6 are the best-characterized downstream signals of [MASK1] and measurement of phosphorylated akt gsk-3\u03b2 and s6 is widely used to determine [MASK1] and mtor activities 12 38 39. [MASK1] deletion by local injections of adeno-associated virus aav-cre into the sensorimotor cortex induced cst axon growth in ptenfloxflox mice 14. given the penetration properties of tat-conjugated peptides into the cns following systemic application and the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier after sci 4042 systemic application of paps is also likely to block [MASK1] activity in neurons at supraspinal levels. these results support that systemic treatments with paps efficiently block [MASK1] activity in the brain as well as in the spinal cord. we next studied whether [MASK1] suppression with paps would stimulate axon growth and functional recovery following dorsal over-hemisection sci at t7 a model that typically transects 67 of the spinal cord including the dorsal dorsolateral and lateral cst fibers but spares some ventral spinal cord 33. we have confirmed the biological activity of this dose of paps 2 and 4 by measuring several signaling proteins downstream of [MASK1] fig. [MASK1] deletion has been reported to promote compensatory sprouting and impressive regeneration of cst axons in sci mice 14. a critical issue is whether pharmacological [MASK1] blockade stimulates growth of cst axons into and beyond the lesion area after sci. thus [MASK1] peptides penetrated into the lesioned spinal cord following systemic application. recent work using conditional knockout mice suggested that [MASK1] is potentially important for controlling the regenerative capacity of injured axons 12 14 16. transgenic deletion of [MASK1] is scientifically very powerful but it only targets a single neuronal population via local injections of aav-cre and not the diffusely-dispersed neurons such as 5-ht neurons or propriospinal interneurons known to contribute to functional recovery after sci 4345 48. [MASK1] deletion has not been shown to contribute to functional return after cns injury and it is not feasible for treating patients. in this study we identified selective antagonist peptides for [MASK1] by targeting its pip2 atp-type pdz and c-terminal tail domains. we demonstrated their binding to [MASK1] over-expressed in cos7 cells promotion on neurite outgrowth and blockade of [MASK1] downstream signals. we demonstrated their binding to [MASK1] over-expressed in cos7 cells promotion on neurite outgrowth and blockade of [MASK1] downstream signals. thus we developed systemically deliverable small peptides to block [MASK1] selectively which were able to promote regrowth of injured cns axons following post-injury administration. axon growth in adult sci rodents following systemic [MASK1] peptide treatments. deletion of [MASK1] or tsc1 stimulated growth in injured rgcs and descending cst neurons by activating mtor 15 16 a key signal to regulate protein synthesis during cell growth. thus [MASK1] and mtor. [MASK1] blockade with small peptides significantly stimulated growth of descending serotonergic tracts fig. [MASK1] deletion in the motor cortex promoted cst regeneration in conditional ko mice with sci 14. 4 [MASK1] inhibition at different neuronal levels might contribute to the enhanced axonal growth in axotomized neurons. in particular both [MASK1] inhibition in the neuronal bodies of the brain and blockade of locally-enriched [MASK1] at growth cones of the spinal cord are likely to regulate axon elongation by altering the activity of the pi3kaktgsk3 signaling pathway 49 50. in particular both [MASK1] inhibition in the neuronal bodies of the brain and blockade of locally-enriched [MASK1] at growth cones of the spinal cord are likely to regulate axon elongation by altering the activity of the pi3kaktgsk3 signaling pathway 49 50. [MASK1] accumulated rapidly at the growth cone membrane following sema3a application and contributed to sema3a- induced growth cone collapse in neurons 49. in contrast the he group demonstrated greater regeneration of injured cst axons in addition to compensatory sprouting in conditional [MASK1] knockout mice 14. it is less clear how regenerating cst axons crossed scar tissues following [MASK1] deletion in conditional knockout mice 14. by using several approaches we have confirmed high efficiency of our sequence-targeting peptides for blocking [MASK1] signaling pathway. paps1-4 bound to [MASK1] protein blocked its downstream signals and promoted significant neurite extension in adult and postnatal neurons cultured on inhibitory substrates fig. nevertheless the time periods for suppressing [MASK1] activity were very distinct between the two studies. began deletion of [MASK1] 48 weeks before injury by injecting aav-cre into the sensorimotor cortex of neonatal or 4-week old mice. [MASK1] inhibition following pap treatment is probably the molecular basis for the increased axon growth and improved behavioral recovery in this study. our peptides selectively bind [MASK1] expressed in transfected mammalian cells and block [MASK1] activity fig2 and 4 due to the sequence overlap with certain domains of [MASK1]. our peptides selectively bind [MASK1] expressed in transfected mammalian cells and block [MASK1] activity fig2 and 4 due to the sequence overlap with certain domains of [MASK1]. our peptides selectively bind [MASK1] expressed in transfected mammalian cells and block [MASK1] activity fig2 and 4 due to the sequence overlap with certain domains of [MASK1]. in contrast the previously reported protective and beneficial effects of bpv in sci rodents 19 20 or in a stroke model 57 might be attributed to inhibition of [MASK1] as well as other tyrosine phosphatases due to less selectivity of bpv 21. it is likely that sprouting regeneration and reorganization of other descending fibers such as rubrospinal axons also contribute to enhanced functional recovery due to widespread expression of [MASK1] in the cns 59. [MASK1] peptides might promote recovery also through other mechanisms such as protecting injured spinal cord tissues enhancing myelination and stimulating proliferation and differentiation of endogenous stem cells. and short-range axon sprouting following [MASK1] suppression. in fact [MASK1] deletion protected rgcs from death after axotomy 12. [MASK1] deficiency resulted in increased myelin thickness and profound and progressive enlargement of most white matter tracts in mice 60. moreover [MASK1] has been shown to regulate development and proliferation of cns stem cells or progenitors 61. of note [MASK1] is expressed in different types of cells and regulates many fundamental cellular functions in the body including apoptosis migration proliferation and growth. dysregulation of [MASK1] has been linked to several disorders such as tumorigenesis and epilepsy 6264. in particular loss of [MASK1] function has been shown to contribute to tumor formation in prostate skin and intestine. the risk of tumor formation may be slight when [MASK1] inhibition with pap treatment is limited to 23 weeks 64.

regenerative ability of adult cortico- spinal neurons. our data show that adeno-associated virus aav expressing short hairpin rna shrna against [MASK1] shpten enhances retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration after crush injury. however compared to the previous data in [MASK1] ko mice aav-shrna results in a lesser degree of regeneration likely due to incomplete gene silencing inherent to rnai. axon regeneration retinal ganglion cell [MASK1] axon injury axon guidance. using optic nerve injury and conditional knockout ko mice we and others have previously demonstrated that deleting phosphatase and tensin homologue [MASK1] and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 socs3 in adult retinal ganglion cells rgc allows long distance optic nerve regeneration and target reinnervation to some degree 13. however whether non-transgenic approaches that modulate [MASK1] alone or with other growth regulating factors can promote a similar level of rgc axon regeneration in wild type animals has not been directly addressed. adeno-associated virus aav lacks significant pathogenicity and has been used safely in clinical trials for a number of ocular and non- ocular diseases 5 therefore the first aim of this present study was to evaluate whether aav vectors that incorporate rna interference rnai can suppress endogenous [MASK1] in adult rgcs and promote rgc axon regeneration in the adult mouse. next we examined whether combined viral rnai and pharmacotherapy approaches that modulate [MASK1] and other growth promoters will further improve long distance regeneration of axons to their brain targets. evaluation of aav2-shrna mediated [MASK1] knockdown and rgc axon regeneration. here we sought to examine the degree of rgc axon regeneration after aav-shrna mediated [MASK1] knockdown. furthermore this design allows insertion of four separate shrna sequences concatenated in a single plasmid each targeting a different region of [MASK1] referred hereafter as shpten4 thereby increasing the probability of effectively silencing the gene of interest. alternatively we used a previously tested [MASK1] targeting sequence 9 10 shown to be highly specific to [MASK1] referred hereafter as shpten110 since aav serotype 2 has been shown to effectively transduce postmitotic neurons including the rgcs 11 these plasmids were then used to produce adeno-associated virus serotype 2 aav-shpten4

of [MASK1] we initially incubated rat cortical neurons with either aav- anti-luciferase-egfp aav-egfp or aav-shpten4. seven days after treatment aav- shpten4 markedly suppresses the endogenous expression of [MASK1] as shown by immunocytochemistry figure 1b n2 biological replicates. in cross-section immunohistochemistry performed two weeks after injection transduced rgcs show a significant

figure 1g we observe about 70 reduction in [MASK1] level after aav-shpten4. consistent with the previous study 9 10 aav-shpten containing a single targeting sequence aav-shpten1 led to approximately 70 reduction in [MASK1] expression in adult rgcs data not shown. as an initial test to examine the effect of [MASK1] knockdown on rgc axon regeneration we injected aav-shpten4 aav-shpten1 or aav-egfp two weeks before an optic nerve crush. we noticed however that the degree of regeneration in the aav-shpten animals is less extensive than that of the [MASK1] ko mice ie. on the other hand more than 20 axons per one optic nerve section were seen at this distance in the [MASK1] ko animals treated with aav-cre 1 since we have previously shown that the level of axotomy-induced cell death is reduced by [MASK1] deletion in rgcs 1 we also assessed whether aav-mediated [MASK1] knockdown will similarly enhance rgc survival. on the other hand more than 20 axons per one optic nerve section were seen at

[MASK1] is one of many factors known to regulate rgc axon regeneration. given the synergistic effects induced by combining [MASK1] ko mice with modulation of the cntfstat3 pathway we sought to test combining rnai and aav approach to target these factors and further improve regeneration. previous studies have demonstrated that rgcs induced to regenerate in [MASK1] ko mice travel the entire length of the optic nerve 1 or in combination with other factors reach the targets 3 25 and induce partial recovery of visual functions 4 while these ko mouse studies have revealed some key molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration it remained to be seen whether a non-transgenic approach that targets [MASK1] alone or in combination can also promote a similar degree of optic nerve regeneration and target re-innervation. previous studies have demonstrated that rgcs induced to regenerate in [MASK1] ko mice travel the entire length of the optic nerve 1 or in combination with other

reported successful uses of non-transgenic [MASK1] blockers to promote axon regeneration after nerve injury. following a spinal cord injury [MASK1] antagonist peptide or aav-shpten were shown to improve axon regeneration in the spinal. cord 9 26 27 others have demonstrated that [MASK1] inhibitor bisperoxovanadium enhances. regeneration of sensory axons 28 however it has not been established whether aav- shrna that suppresses [MASK1] would induce regeneration in rgc axons. more importantly whether combining rnai knockdown of [MASK1] with other non-transgenic strategies known to increase neurons growth ability could further enhance long distance axon regeneration has not been directly addressed. here we compare rates of rgc axon regeneration following [MASK1] knockdown using two aav vectors each carrying different [MASK1] target sequences. here we compare rates of rgc axon regeneration following [MASK1] knockdown using two aav vectors each carrying different [MASK1] target sequences. despite protein knockdown efficacy as high as 7090 the effect on axon regeneration is far less robust than that seen after [MASK1] deletion in transgenic mice. silencing of pro-regenerative genes however this is unlikely since the two aav-shpten vectors target different sequences within [MASK1]. furthermore the shpten1 used in this study was previously shown to cause no detectable off-target effects when the closest potential off-target genes were examined 10 thus it is more likely that the weaker regeneration seen with rnai is due to incomplete [MASK1] silencing a common limitation in the use of shrna technology 29 in many instances a low level of residual expression may still be sufficient for gene function. for example conditional [MASK1] heterozygote mice typically display less severe phenotypes than null- homozygotes 30 in accordance we observe no obvious increase in axon regeneration after heterozygous [MASK1] ablation ie. for example conditional [MASK1]

[MASK1] knockdown leads to increased mtor signaling revealed by increased levels of ps6. as shown in  e and 1f in contrast to 20 survival in the control group about 50 of rgcs survived after dclk2 overexpression an effect comparable to that observed with [MASK1] deletion c. considering its relatively weak effect on pro- moting axon regeneration compared to [MASK1] deletion  c d a and b such a strong effect of dclk2 on neuronal survival was unexpected suggesting a possible role of cytoskel- etal dynamics in regulating injury-induced neuronal survival. dclk2 substantiates the survival and regeneration effects of [MASK1] deletion. as our previous studies indicated that manipulating the mtor pathway could enhance neuronal regeneration    we tested the combinatorial outcomes of dclk2 overex- pression and [MASK1] deletion. as shown in c dclk2 overexpression further enhanced neuronal survival from approximately 50 to 70 when compared to the [MASK1] deletion alone. importantly dclk2 resulted in a significant enhancement of axon regeneration induced by [MASK1] deletion a and 2b. in [MASK1]-- rgcs although dclk12 underwent an injury-induced downregulation figures s1c and s1d some residual dclk12 still remained figures s1c and s1d possibly as the result of the effects of [MASK1] deletion on protein translation. because of the poor survival of rgcs in explants made from wt postnatal mice we used explants with rgcs carrying the [MASK1] deletion ptenff mice with prior aav-cre injection to maintain survival of rgcs which served as controls for further investigating the effects of dclk2 overexpression. this is especially obvious for rgcs with [MASK1] deletion figures s1c and s1d. strikingly co-deletion of dclk1 and dclk2 abolished nearly all axon regeneration usually observed with [MASK1] deletion  b 4c s3a and s3b. these results suggest that dclk1  and 2 might be functionally redundant and their collective activ- ities are required for optic nerve regeneration induced by [MASK1] deletion. this might be due to the high survival rates induced by [MASK1] deletion. figure 4 dclk12 are required for optic nerve regeneration induced by [MASK1] deletion. as [MASK1] deletion has only a modest promoting effect on sciatic nerve regeneration  we do not expect a major impact of [MASK1] deletion on our results. as [MASK1] deletion has only a modest promoting effect on sciatic nerve regeneration  we do not expect a major impact of [MASK1] deletion on our results. thus we generated an aav2 to overexpress the mt-binding domain of dcx dcx-270 a  and tested its effects on axon regeneration after optic nerve injury in the background of [MASK1] deletion. in addition to promoting the initiation of axon regeneration dcx members also greatly enhance axon elongation induced by [MASK1] deletion suggesting a new set of targets for promoting axon regeneration after injury. or targeting inhibitory factors intrinsic to injured neu- rons such as [MASK1]  pde4   klf4  and socs3  have led to enhanced axon growth and recovery in various pre- clinical models. [MASK1] as a suppressor of regeneration was identified from a survey of six genes in optic nerve regeneration. [MASK1] is a lipid phosphatase that metabolizes pi345p3 and suppresses axon regeneration by negatively regulating the pi3kmtor pathway. we identified 18 phosphatase suppressors from the screen including one known inhibitor of axon growth [MASK1] and 17 novel genes. for comparison human brain expression of [MASK1] was accessed from the same database httpwwwncbi. aside from [MASK1] which removes the 3-phosphate from pi345p3 the pro- teins encoded by two other hit genes regulate phosphoinositide me- tabolism. rna-seq data expressed in frag- ments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped fpkm from lllumina human body map 20 indicate that inpp5f is expressed at a higher level in adult brain than [MASK1] at the mrna level. [MASK1] itself ranks within the top 125 of high- est expressed genes in the adult human brain inpp5f vs [MASK1] 161 vs 655 fpkm ncbi aceview.

[MASK1] mos did not stimulate rgc death tunel assay or proliferation brdu incorporation. tunel and brdu labeling indicated no ef- fect of [MASK1] mos on rgc death or proliferation. jakstat signaling is necessary for optic nerve regeneration jakstat signaling stimulates optic axon regeneration in  mam-  mals      and [MASK1] gene expression often reflects jakstat. thus unlike mammals where basal [MASK1] expression is sufficient to inhibit optic nerve regeneration ze- brafish activate an inhibitory pathway during optic nerve regen- eration and still retain a robust regenerative response. we think this immunofluorescence accurately reflects jakstat signaling because knockdown of reg- ulators of jakstat signaling such as [MASK1] and gp130 predict- ably affected p-stat3 expression. this is a new function for sfpq and was reminiscent of that reported for [MASK1] deletion in mice. we also found sfpq mrna expressed in the mouse retina and suspect that it may collaborate with [MASK1] in inhibiting optic nerve regenera- tion in mammals. there are no reports of [MASK1] and sfpq direct interactions or effects on each others genes. however both sfpq and [MASK1] have been reported to interact with the paraspeckle protein nono which can regulate rna expression. smith pd sun f park kk cai b wang c kuwako k martinez-carrasco i connolly l he z 2009 [MASK1] deletion promotes optic nerve regen- eration in vivo. song ks kim k chung kc seol jh yoon jh 2008 interaction of [MASK1] with nono attenuates il-1beta-dependent muc8 gene expression. sun f park kk belin s wang d lu t chen g zhang k yeung c feng g yankner ba he z 2011 sustained axon regeneration induced by co- deletion of pten and [MASK1].

unclear. although genetic manipulations of [MASK1] can enhance axonal regeneration after optic injury the role of [MASK1] in dendritic outgrowth after spinal cord injury sci is still unclear. the present study investigated the endogenous expression of [MASK1] and its role in regulating neurite outgrowth in vitro. inter- leukin-6 il-6 induces [MASK1] expression at the mrna and protein levels in neuroscreen- 1 ns-1 cells. in addition we determined if reduction of [MASK1] expression by microinjection of lenti-shsocs3 into spinal cord enhances dendrite outgrowth in spinal cord neurons after sci. knocking down of [MASK1] in spinal cord neurons with lenti- shsocs3 increased complete sci-induced p-stat3 tyr705. suggest that knocking down of [MASK1] enhances dendritic regeneration and prevents demyelination after sci. suppressors of cytokine signaling-3 [MASK1] one member of the socs family of proteins binds to gp130 a common receptor for signal transduction with interleukin-6 il-6 or to jak1 and jak2 subsequently inhibiting signal transduction. expression of [MASK1] in neurons plays a negative role in regulating cell survival and neurite outgrowth. however the mechanisms underlying the regulatory effects of [MASK1] on dendritic growth after complete sci are still not clear. in the current study we hypothesized that [MASK1] expression in neurons negatively regu- lates neurite outgrowth in vitro and dendrite outgrowth after sci. we also investigated whether [MASK1] expression regulates dendritic arborization and demyelination after complete sci in adult rats. quantitative real-time pcr qpcr was per- formed as previously described to determine levels of [MASK1] mrna. two lentiviral plasmids provided by dr etty benveniste university of alabama at birming-

we tested whether [MASK1] expression was regulated upon il-6 treatment in ns-1 cells. without il-6 treatment basal expression levels of [MASK1] mrna were very low. however after il-6 treatment [MASK1] mrna expression was significantly increased at 30 min peaked at 12 h and remained at a high level until 4 h. [MASK1] protein expression was also significantly increased between 0252 h in ns-1 cells upon il-6 treatment. reduction of [MASK1] expression enhanced neurite outgrowth in ns-1 cells. recent studies demonstrate that genetic knockout of [MASK1] expression can promote axon regeneration after optic nerve injury  indicating that [MASK1] is as an intrinsic barrier and has a negative regulatory effect on axonal regeneration. recent studies demonstrate that genetic knockout of [MASK1] expression can promote axon regeneration after optic nerve injury  indicating that [MASK1] is as an intrinsic barrier and has a negative regulatory effect on axonal regeneration. thus we investigated the regulation of [MASK1] on il-6-induced neur- ite outgrowth by ns-1 cells. first we investigated whether il-6-induced [MASK1] expression is inhibited by lentivirus-delivered shrna targeting endogenous [MASK1] shsocs3. first we investigated whether il-6-induced [MASK1] expression is inhibited by lentivirus-delivered shrna targeting endogenous [MASK1] shsocs3. 6 qpcr analysis showed that shsocs3 expression by lenti-shsocs3 infection led to a signifi- cant reduction in il-6-induced [MASK1] mrna expression. comparable to these results [MASK1] protein expression was also decreased by lenti-shsocs3 upon il-6 treatment  as compared to those cells infected with lenti-pgipz. next ns-1 cells were infected with lenti-shsocs3 or lenti-pgipz and then treated with il-6 to determine if [MASK1] regulates neurite outgrowth. we observed that reduced [MASK1] expression by lenti-shsocs3 enhanced il-6-induced outgrowth of neur- ites as compared to lenti-pgipz-infected cells 18 fold increase. induction of [MASK1] expression by il-6 in ns-1 cells. a [MASK1] mrna expression was significantly increased after il-6 treatment. b protein expression of [MASK1] was significantly increased after il-6 treatment. decreased [MASK1] expression enhanced p-stat3 tyr705 after complete sci. our previous studies reported that lenti-shsocs3 infection in spinal cord reduced complete sci-induced mrna and protein expression of [MASK1] as compared to lenti-pgipz infection. as previously reported  we applied lenti-shsocs3 two weeks prior to com- plete sci to decrease [MASK1] expression. reduction of [MASK1] expression increased map-2 dendrites after complete sci. we next investigated if the negative regulatory effects of [MASK1] on neurite outgrowth in ns-1 cells can be also observed in spinal cord neurons after complete sci. similar enhancement effects on map-2 dendrites were also observed when lentivirus delivering the second shrna lenti-shsocs3 2 specifically knocking down [MASK1]  was applied. reduced [MASK1] expression contributed to neuritic outgrowth in ns-1 cells. ns-1 cells were infected with lenti-shsocs3 shsocs3 or lenti- pgipz pgipz then treated with il-6 for 1 h and harvested for analyses by qrt-pcr of [MASK1] mrna expression a or by immunoblotting of [MASK1]. ns-1 cells were infected with lenti-shsocs3 shsocs3 or lenti- pgipz pgipz then treated with il-6 for 1 h and harvested for analyses by qrt-pcr of [MASK1] mrna expression a or by immunoblotting of [MASK1]. these results strongly suggest that the effects of lenti- shsocs3 in protecting map-2 dendrites from sci-induced decreases are specifically medi- ated by reduced [MASK1] expression rather than off target effects of shrna. to further investigate whether [MASK1] expression negatively regulates dendrite outgrowth of spinal cord neurons into the white matter after complete sci map-2 dendritic length was analyzed. in contrast when compared to lenti-pgipz infection reduction of [MASK1] expression by lenti-shsocs3 resulted in longer map-2 dendrites at both 1  and. these data suggested that reduction of [MASK1] in spinal cord promotes local dendritic growth after complete sci andor prevents dendrites from sci-induced dying back degeneration in the white matter. reduction of [MASK1] expression enhanced sci-induced gap-43 expression. prevention of demyelination by reducing [MASK1] expression after complete sci. in the present study we investigated whether reduction of [MASK1] expression by lenti-shsocs3 can decrease sci-induced demyelination. these results support the con- cept that lenti-shsocs3 decreased demyelination after complete sci specifically by reducing [MASK1] expression. lenti-shsocs3 could block such negative regulation by reducing [MASK1] expression. we further investigated the role of knocked down [MASK1] in pro- moting dendritic growthregeneration and myelination after complete sci. reduction of [MASK1] by lenti-shsocs3 increased map-2 dendrites both density and length at both 1 and 4 weeks after sci. the current results are

[MASK1] expression in neurons plays a negative role in regulating neuritic outgrowth. in drg neurons over-expression of [MASK1] inhibits neuritic outgrowth. reported that in optic nerve conditional deletion of [MASK1] promoted regeneration of injured optic nerve axons. in [MASK1]-gp130 double knockout mice the regeneration effect was ablated suggesting that the effects of [MASK1] deletion in regu- lating optic nerve regeneration are mediated by gp130  the common signal transducing receptor for all il-6 family members. moreover we observed that reduction of [MASK1] by lenti-shsocs3 in rat spinal cord neu- rons enhances map-2 dendritic growth after complete sci. reduced [MASK1] expression enhanced gap-43 expression in the spinal cord after complete sci. [MASK1] negatively regulates neuritic growth by inhibiting il-6-induced p-stat3 tyr705. collectively these findings suggest that knocked down [MASK1] promotes local dendritic growthregeneration. these results coincide with several other reports showing that [MASK1] is an intrinsic factor for the negative regulation of axonal regeneration after injury in the central nervous system cns. furthermore our previous studies demonstrated that reduction of [MASK1] protects neurons from cell death after sci. thus the enhancement effects of reduced [MASK1] on map-2 dendritic outgrowth in spinal cord after sci might be partially attributable to a greater number of healthy neurons surviving after sci. in the current study we demonstrated that there is a significant reduction of map-2 dendritic projections in white matter after complete sci and that reduction of [MASK1] expression in spinal cord neurons can decrease sci-induced loss of map-2 dendritic projections in terms of both dendritic density and length. the function of [MASK1] in the brain is cell type-specific. several lines of evidence suggest that in microglia [MASK1] inhibits cytokine-induced immune and inflammatory responses in vitro   and that in astrocytes [MASK1] enhances inhibition of chemokine expression and t-cell migration  suggesting that [MASK1] expression in macrophages microglia and astrocytes suppresses brain inflammation. several lines of evidence suggest that in microglia [MASK1] inhibits cytokine-induced immune and inflammatory responses in vitro   and that in astrocytes [MASK1] enhances inhibition of chemokine expression and t-cell migration  suggesting that [MASK1] expression in macrophages microglia and astrocytes suppresses brain inflammation. several lines of evidence suggest that in microglia [MASK1] inhibits cytokine-induced immune and inflammatory responses in vitro   and that in astrocytes [MASK1] enhances inhibition of chemokine expression and t-cell migration  suggesting that [MASK1] expression in macrophages microglia and astrocytes suppresses brain inflammation. reduced [MASK1] expression decreased sci-induced demyelination in white matter of spinal cord. reduction of [MASK1] mrna expression using lentiviral plasmids encoding either shsocs3 or shsocs3 2 which are two different shrnas specific to [MASK1]. reduction of [MASK1] mrna expression using lentiviral plasmids encoding either shsocs3 or shsocs3 2 which are two different shrnas specific to [MASK1]. shsy-5y cells were infected with lenti-pgipz pgipz lenti-shsocs3 2 shsocs3 2 or lenti- shsocs3 shsocs3 and then treated with oncostatin m osm for 1 h mrna was then analyzed by qpcr for [MASK1] mrna expression. socs1 and [MASK1] in the control of cns immunity. schmitz j weissenbach m haan s heinrich pc schaper f [MASK1] exerts its inhibitory function on interleukin-6 signal transduction through the shp2 recruitment site of gp130. expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 [MASK1] and its role in neuronal death after complete spinal cord injury.

[MASK1] treatment abrogated ps6 staining in retinal ganglion cells rgcs arrows. fish were either treated with dmso c or 02 \u00b5m [MASK1] rap d prior to tissue preparation. [MASK1] treatment abolished ps6 staining in amacrines arrowheads. interestingly reduced regeneration was also observed upon temporary [MASK1] treatment early after optic nerve crush 03 dpi correlating with increased mtor activity in rgcs. on the other hand late [MASK1] application 418 dpi had no effect on visual recovery indicating that the delay of functional recovery was caused by abolished mtor activation in rgcs within the first days after injury and that mtor induction in cholinergic amacrines at later time points is negligible for optic nerve regeneration. overall mtor signaling seems not absolutely essential for axonal regeneration as [MASK1] could only delay rather than completely block axon growth and functional recovery. moreover inhibition of mtor using [MASK1] significantly reduced axonal regeneration in vivo and compromised functional recovery after optic nerve injury. accordingly [MASK1] as an established mtor inhibitor diminished ps6 levels in retinal cell cultures   as well as in vivo. similar to mouse rgcs basal neurite growth in cell culture was not affected by [MASK1] treatment in zebrafish as ps6- negative rgcs grew neurites equally well   and this study. consistent with previous reports     application of the cytokine cntf or   the pten-inhibitor pbvphen  increased  ps6  levels  as  well as neurite length in culture and this growth-promotion was abrogated in the presence of [MASK1]. in  mice  rgcs  on  the contrary [MASK1] could only compromise the neurite growth promoting effect of cntf on  myelin  substrate  but  not on laminin. similar to its effect in culture [MASK1] reduced but not completely blocked axonal regrowth in vivo. therefore  it  is  quite  conceivable  that  the partial inhibition of axonal regeneration upon [MASK1] treatment reflects impaired pi3kaktmtor signaling which consistent with  our  in  vitro  results  would  depend  on  lif or other cytokine release shortly after axotomy. on the other hand the number of regenerating mouse rgc axons upon inflammatory stimulation was reduced by [MASK1] treatment only at long distances whereas the extent of short axons remained unaffected. in zebrafish axon regeneration after optic nerve crush was significantly compromised but not completely inhibited by [MASK1] suggesting a comparable ancillary role of mtor in  this  regeneration-competent  species. obviously systemic [MASK1] treatment could inhibit mtor activity in cell types other than rgcs. for example mtor signaling has been shown to regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation and cns myelination     and the positive effects of [MASK1] treatment after contusive spinal cord injury have been partly attributed    to reduced secondary neural tissue damage due to suppression of macrophagemicroglia activation and abrogation of reactive astrogliosis. in addition it is now known that chronic [MASK1] treatment could inhibit mtorc2 just  as the classic target mtorc1 thereby potentially affecting cytoskeleton  dynamics. nevertheless the conclusion of  a  rather  rgc-specific  effect  of our results is supported by the time course of mtor activation and the differential functional recovery upon timed [MASK1] treatment. axon regeneration was only compromised in zebrafish receiving [MASK1] at early time  points  after  optic nerve crush 03 dpi when mtor was markedly. induced in rgcs whereas delayed [MASK1] treatment 418 dpi had no effect. similarly the observed reduction of regenerating axons upon [MASK1] treatment could not be ascribed to impaired gfp marker expression. in contrast to mtor- dependent induction of gap43 in  injured  rodent  sciatic nerves   no reduction of gap43 promoter- driven gfp transcription was detected  in  zebrafish  retinae  upon [MASK1] treatment. this result is in accordance with data showing no  influence  of  [MASK1]  on  the  expression  of gap43 and other regeneration-associated genes in rodent retinae after inflammatory stimulation   and again indicates that inhibition of mtor activity does not generally impair the transformation of rgcs into a regenerative state. mammalian target of [MASK1] mtor activation increases

[MASK1] expression is down-regulated in rgcs in response to injury. our further analysis has been focused on [MASK1] which was one of the most connective nodes of the regulator network figure 2b 2c and table s4. [MASK1] was not among the 1409 proteins identified by proteomics analysis table s1 and s2 possibly due to its low protein abundance in adult rgcs. however among 62 injury-altered proteins identified from our proteomics analysis 10 proteins highlighted in red in table s4 have functional interactions with [MASK1] in the network. importantly similar to mtor howell et al 2013 laplante and sabatini

experiments figure 1 we observed that the expression of [MASK1] mrna is decreased by 70 after injury figure 3a b. this injury-induced [MASK1] down-regulation was also verified by immunohistochemistry. these results together verified the injury-induced [MASK1] down-regulation in injured rgcs. over-expression of [MASK1] in rgcs promotes axon regeneration in vivo. we next assessed the effects of [MASK1] over-expression on neuronal responses by two different approaches. first as we demonstrated previously injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 2 aav2 vectors into the vitreous body results in highly selective and efficient transduction to rgcs park et al 2008 sun et al 2011 thus we injected aav2 expressing [MASK1] or a control placenta alkaline phosphatase plap into the vitreous body of adult mice. at 2 weeks post-injury we observed that 49 of rgcs survived in [MASK1] over-expressing mice whereas only 25 survived in the mice injected with aav2-plap figure s3a b. importantly a significant axonal growth increase was observed in the optic nerves from [MASK1] over-expressing mice figure s3c d suggesting that [MASK1] over-expression could promote both neuronal survival and axon

robust than what was observed after aav2- [MASK1] expression figure s3 possibly due to a more efficient expression of [MASK1] in these transgenic mice. as shown in figure s4 rgcs with [MASK1] over-expression still exhibited significant injury-induced mtor down-regulation although the extent of down-regulation is less than that observed for the controls. these data further support the notion that [MASK1] over-expression is able to promote rgcs axons regeneration after optic nerve injury. delayed [MASK1] over-expression still promotes optic nerve regeneration. to mimic clinically relevant settings we assessed the effects of expressing [MASK1] after a delayed post-injury period. animals with delayed [MASK1] expression with many regenerating axons growing beyond the injury site and extending 15mm from the crush site figures 4b and 4c. as the apoptotic pathways might be activated at these axotomized rgcs figure 2 our results suggest that [MASK1] can rescue these injured neurons from apoptotic death and promote their axon regeneration. the experiments above implicated injury-induced [MASK1] down-regulation as an important mechanism reducing the intrinsic regenerative ability of adult rgcs. we then investigated whether [MASK1] is required for axon regeneration in adult rgcs induced by other manipulations. the knockout of [MASK1] significantly reduced the numbers of regenerating axons figure s5a b but did not affect neuronal survival figure s5c d or the mtor activity figure s5e. however some residual regenerating axons were still observed after [MASK1] deletion figure s5a b. it remains unclear whether this result reflects the differential involvement of [MASK1] in rgcs subtypes or the compensatory effects of other myc members. our systems biology analyses of the pathways involved in the neuronal response to injury strongly suggest that other major signaling hubs work in concert with [MASK1] figure 2b c. to better understand their functional interactions we analyzed the combinatorial effects in the optic nerve injury model by manipulating both [MASK1] and the mtor pathway which was also implicated by the network analysis figure 2. two weeks after injury we observed significant increase in neuronal survival and axon regeneration in the ptenff mice with [MASK1] expression with around 75 of rgcs alive figure 5bd. however with additional [MASK1] expression. while some axons grew ectopically into the contralateral optic nerve many more axons crossed the chiasm and continued to grow in the optic tracts with some ipsilaterally and more contralaterally figure 6b e after crossing the chiasm many regenerating axons derail from the optic tract similar to that shown by luo et al 2013 at 8 weeks post-injury while most of regenerating axons disappeared in the mice with ptensocs3 deletion without [MASK1] expression many regenerating axons remain in the mice with triple treatment figure s7. as shown in figure 7 the [MASK1] expression level measured by quantitative qpcr with the mrna samples from drgs was significantly increased at 1 day post-injury but returned to the basal levels from 3 days post-injury. consistent with the regulation of c- myc transcripts the protein abundance of [MASK1] as measured using anti-[MASK1] antibodies showed delayed increase at 3 days post-injury figure 7b. our further analysis on [MASK1] provides compelling evidence verifying the role of such novel molecular players in neuronal injury responses. importantly both [MASK1] and mtor are differentially regulated in regeneration-competent peripheral sensory neurons suggesting a possibility that the role of these molecules in affecting the intrinsic regenerative ability might not limited to a single neuronal types. how [MASK1] acts in injury responses remains unclear. [MASK1] is described as being a master transcription factor that regulates genes involved in different aspects of anabolic metabolism such as ribosome biogenesis lipid synthesis nucleic acid synthesis intermediary metabolism and cell growth and proliferation dang 2013. our data suggests that the activity of [MASK1] is a key step towards achieving successful axon regeneration after an injury to over-ride a shift in metabolic state that usually results in the degeneration of axons and eventual apoptosis. therefore a plausible model is that [MASK1] alone or together with mtor might allow injured neurons to achieve such a shift of metabolic states for axonal regrowth. on the other hand recent studies documented an increase in [MASK1] protein in the promoter region of active genes as opposed to regulating the expression of specific genes thus amplifying the overall output of the existing gene expression program in tumor cells lin et al 2012 nie et al 2012. thus an alternative model is that [MASK1] might act similarly in neurons by boosting the general gene expression which may explain its dramatic effect on increasing the regeneration observed in combination with the ptensocs3 deletion. sections or whole mount retinas were incubated over night at 4c with primary antibodies tuj-1 1400 covance p-s6 1200-cell signaling neun 1100-millipore and [MASK1] 1200-abcam diluted in pbs-3bsa-0. jager r maurer j jacob a schorle h cell type-specific conditional regulation of the [MASK1] proto- oncogene by combining creloxp recombination and tamoxifen-mediated activation. transcriptional amplification in tumor cells with elevated [MASK1].

[MASK1] promotes rgc growth of non-\u03b1rgcs. before assessing the ability of [MASK1] to affect regeneration we investigated its role in the normal development of \u03b1rgcs. we found that the difference in size between \u03b1rgc and non-\u03b1rgc somata arose during the first postnatal week whereas [MASK1] was not detectable in rgcs until the second postnatal week fig. these results suggested that [MASK1] is dispensable for the initial growth of rgcs. consistent with this idea we found no significant difference in size between control and [MASK1] \u03b1rgcs during the period of peak growth or in adulthood fig. mtor signaling or selective expression of [MASK1] is required for \u03b1rgcs to reach their normal size. we also asked whether [MASK1] can promote growth of rgcs in adults using aav-mediated gene transfer of [MASK1] as described above. we also asked whether [MASK1] can promote growth of rgcs in adults using aav-mediated gene transfer of [MASK1] as described above. rgc soma size measured by area in sections increased by 30 over controls 4 weeks after introduction of [MASK1] to a broad range of rgc types using thy1-cre mice fig. analysis with subtype-specific markers indicated that small w3 rgcs were affected disproportionately 80 increase in area whereas the size of \u03b1rgcs did not increase in the presence of supernormal levels of [MASK1] fig. together these results indicate that [MASK1] does not play an essential role in the development of \u03b1rgcs but can elicit rgc growth and mtor signaling in adult retina. [MASK1] plus igf-1 promotes axonal regeneration. to ask whether [MASK1] could promote axonal regeneration following nerve injury we used the optic nerve crush protocol described above but infected retinal cells with aav expressing [MASK1] instead of shpten. to ask whether [MASK1] could promote axonal regeneration following nerve injury we used the optic nerve crush protocol described above but infected retinal cells with aav expressing [MASK1] instead of shpten. immunostaining showed expression of [MASK1] in 80 of rgcs in injured retina data not shown but regeneration was not significantly more effective in its presence than in control retinas fig. [MASK1] and igf-1 promoted rgc survival to a modest extent fig. we then tested the relationship of [MASK1] igf-1 and mtor activation as promoters of regeneration. igf-1 on its own had no detectable effect of mtor signaling in rgcs following axotomy but expression of [MASK1] with or without igf-1 enhanced mtor signaling following axotomy as it did in normal retina fig. moreover rapamycin a potent and specific inhibitor of mtor laplante and sabatini 2012 blocked axonal regeneration promoted by [MASK1] plus igf-1 fig. conversely regeneration promoted by shpten is affected little if at all in [MASK1] mice. these data place mtor signaling downstream of [MASK1] in a molecular pathway that promotes regeneration. stimulatory role of igf-1 was not unique and [MASK1] can promote substantial axon regeneration when paired with growth factors. [MASK1] plus igf-1 promotes selective regeneration of \u03b1rgcs. we expected that administration of [MASK1] plus igf-1 to most or all rgcs would promote regeneration in multiple rgc types. the ability to selectively target \u03b1rgcs provides an opportunity to ask whether the delivery of [MASK1] directly to \u03b1rgcs promote regeneration. to this end we used an aav in which expression of [MASK1] was cre-dependent and limited over-expression to \u03b1rgcs by infecting retinas of kcng4-yfp mice. \u03b1rgc-specific expression of [MASK1] promoted \u03b1rgc regeneration following nerve crush fig. thus one factor contributing to selective responsiveness of \u03b1rgcs to [MASK1] plus growth factors is selective expression of the growth factor receptors. levels of ps6 fell dramatically in rgcs following axotomy as shown previously park et al 2008 and introduction of shpten or [MASK1] plus igf-1 restored its levels. 90 of ps6-rich rgcs following shpten treatment and 60 of ps6-rgcs following [MASK1] plus igf-1 treatment. 3a levels of praptor paralleled those of ps6 \u03b1rgcs accounted for 90 of praptor-rich rgcs following either shpten treatment or [MASK1] plus igf-1 administration fig. the expression level did not differ detectably between \u03b1rgcs and non-\u03b1rgcs and did not change detectably following shpten treatment or [MASK1] plus igf-1 administrationfig. we then analyzed factors that promote regeneration of those rgcs that survive and identified [MASK1] as a promoter of rgc growth and regeneration. [MASK1] as a promoter of axon regeneration. [MASK1] is a secreted glycosylated phosphoprotein it was discovered as a component of bone matrix but has since been shown to be synthesized by many cell types and to affect multiple cellular processes including adhesion proliferation and survival kahles et al 2014 kazanecki et al 2007 wang and denhardt 2008. levels are affected by neural injury in several systems and [MASK1] is reported to exert both pro- and anti- inflammatory roles that can promote neuronal survival and regeneration carecchio and comi 2011 chidlow et al 2008 del rio et al 2011 hashimoto et al 2007 misawa et al 2012 wright et al 2014. in the retina in contrast directed delivery reveals that neuron-derived [MASK1] promotes regeneration. [MASK1] may be useful for promoting regeneration for several reasons. [MASK1] may circumvent this potentially dangerous activity. in other systems [MASK1] acts as an extracellular cytokine kahles et al 2014. therefore a soluble form of [MASK1] together with a growth factor might represent a therapeutic method of transiently activating regenerative ability in mature neurons. regeneration promoted by [MASK1] plus igf-1 or shpten is restricted to \u03b1rgcs. first why are endogenous [MASK1] and mtor both of which are enriched in adult \u03b1rgcs insufficient to promote their regeneration. second why is regeneration restricted to \u03b1rgcs even when [MASK1] plus igf-1 or shpten is supplied to most rgcs. we hypothesized that [MASK1] might also decrease following axotomy but detected no striking changes in [MASK1] levels by immunohistochemistry or in [MASK1] mrna levels by rt-pcr data not shown. we hypothesized that [MASK1] might also decrease following axotomy but detected no striking changes in [MASK1] levels by immunohistochemistry or in [MASK1] mrna levels by rt-pcr data not shown. we hypothesized that [MASK1] might also decrease following axotomy but detected no striking changes in [MASK1] levels by immunohistochemistry or in [MASK1] mrna levels by rt-pcr data not shown. however our immunohistochemical methods are non-quantitative and decreases in [MASK1] mrna abundance in rgcs would have been masked by known increases in microglia chidlow et al 2008. moreover [MASK1] is heterogeneous in several respects there are several alternatively spliced isoforms at least in humans many forms of post-translational modification and an alternative translation product that remains intracellular and mediates activities distinct from those of the secreted isoform gimba and tilli 2013 inoue and shinohara 2011 kazanecki et al 2007. for reasons we do not yet understand [MASK1] upregulates mtor signaling selectively in \u03b1rgcs following axotomy even though it can upregulate mtor signaling in most rgcs in uninjured retina. likewise [MASK1] can up-regulate mtor signaling in the presence or absence of a growth factor but does not induce regeneration unless accompanied by a growth factor.

", "b-raf": "[MASK1] kinase drives developmental axon growth and promotes axon regeneration in the injured mature cns. here we demonstrate that condi- tional activation of [MASK1] kinase alone in mouse embryonic neurons is sufficient to drive the growth of long-range peripheral sensory axon projections in vivo in the absence of upstream neurotrophin signaling. we further show that activated [MASK1] signaling enables robust regenerative growth of sensory axons into the spinal cord after a dorsal root crush  as well as substantial axon regrowth in the crush-lesioned optic nerve. [MASK1] ngf nerve growth factor rgc retinal ganglion cell sci spinal cord injury. furthermore it is un- clear whether this pathway can promote axon growth in neuronal populations beyond the sen- sory neurons and the extent to which it can be harnessed to promote regeneration in the in- jured central nervous system cnsto address these questions we have used conditional [MASK1] gain-of-function mouse models to  show that. g [MASK1] protein levels are not increased in e125 drg and spinal cord of. activation of [MASK1] signaling alone is sufficient to promote sensory axon extension during early development. to this end we first conditionally activated raf signaling in a wt background using a genetically modified loxp-stop- loxp-brafv600e lsl-kabraf knock-in mouse line mercer et al 2005 in which a kinase-activated [MASK1] kab-raf mutant is expressed from the endogenous [MASK1] locus upon cre recombinationwe next bred lsl-kabraf mice with a neuronal. to this end we first conditionally activated raf signaling in a wt background using a genetically modified loxp-stop- loxp-brafv600e lsl-kabraf knock-in mouse line mercer et al 2005 in which a kinase-activated [MASK1] kab-raf mutant is expressed from the endogenous [MASK1] locus upon cre recombinationwe next bred lsl-kabraf mice with a neuronal. [MASK1] activation did not affect mtor phosphory- lation fig. because the expression of kab-raf is under the control of endogenous [MASK1] pro- moter the expression level of [MASK1] protein is not changed in. because the expression of kab-raf is under the control of endogenous [MASK1] pro- moter the expression level of [MASK1] protein is not changed in. [MASK1] activation rescues nociceptor axon extension in embryos lacking trka. thus sustained [MASK1] kinase activity can to a large extent substitute for trka-mediated axon growth signaling in presumptive trka sensory neurons. figure 4 activation of [MASK1] indirectly rescues cgrp expression in trka noci- ceptive neurons. c activation of [MASK1] does not directly induce cgrp expression in cultured drg neurons. [MASK1] gain-of-function restored cgrp expression in the absence of trka fig. these data together indicate that the restoration of cgrp expression in lsl-kabrafnes-cretrkabax  drg neu- rons is not directly caused by the elevation of neuron-intrinsic [MASK1] activity but indirectly through the restoration of cu- taneous innervation and subsequent retrograde signaling from skin-derived factors. in [MASK1] gain-of-function mice we observed excessive growth of both nociceptive and proprioceptive afferents fig. 5 c suggesting that the effect of kab-raf expressed from the endogenous [MASK1] locus depends strictly on canonical signaling. figure 5     activation of [MASK1] drives overgrowth of centrally projecting nociceptive and proprioceptive drg axons in the e185 spinal     cord. phenotype suggested that reactivation of the [MASK1] path- way in injured adult neurons might be exploited to pro- mote regeneration. figure 6 activation of [MASK1] signaling in mature drg neurons elevates their growth competency. figure 7 activation of [MASK1] signaling enables crushed sensory axons to regenerate into adult spinal cord. b and d mice expressing activated [MASK1] in drgs lsl-kabrafbrn3a-creert2. to test whether activation of [MASK1] signaling can drive ma- ture sensory axon regeneration we generated lsl-kabraf tdtomato tdtombrn3a-creert2 mice to inducibly express kab-raf in adult drg neuronsthe brn3a-creert2 deleter mouse line was generated using a brn3a promoter eng et al 2001 which mediates expression selectively in sensory neu- rons fig. we first assessed [MASK1] gain-of-function in cultured adult neurons. 7 dthus elevation of intrinsic [MASK1] signaling is sufficient both in vitro and in vivo to induce robust axon regrowth of adult drg neurons and importantly renders the axons capable of overcoming growth-inhibitory signals that are abundant at the drez and within the spinal cord. to test whether activation of [MASK1] kinase signaling can pro- mote axon regeneration of injured mature cns neurons we used an optic nerve regeneration model fig. figure 8 activation of [MASK1] enables regenerative  axon growth in the crush-lesioned optic nerve via the canonical effectors mek12. to test whether combined activation of the [MASK1] and pi3- kinasemtor pathways can further boost axon growth ca- pacity in injured adult retinal ganglion neurons we performed the optic nerve regeneration experiments using double lsl- kabrafptenff mice. the synergistic effect of activating both [MASK1] and pi3-kinase signaling is most apparent at the long- est lengths of axon regeneration fig. activation of [MASK1] in neurons is sufficient to drive sensory axon growth in the embryo to enable adult sensory axons to regenerate across the drez and further into the spinal cord and to induce robust regeneration of adult retinal axons in the injured optic nerve. we should note that this pathway seems to be selective to axon growth signaling because we have never ob- served that [MASK1] activation supports neuronal survival un- published data. furthermore [MASK1] has been shown to directly interact with tubulin bonfiglio et al 2011. activation of [MASK1] signaling is also likely to trigger the expression of axon growthenhancing gene sets in injured neurons. the developmental phenotypes we observed in the [MASK1] gain-of-function embryos were generally comple- mentary to those previously observed in b-rafc-raf loss-of-function mice zhong et al 2007. notably we found that activation of [MASK1] resulted in over- growth of both proprioceptive and nociceptive axons in the spinal cord whereas the expression of two known repulsive signaling molecules in the dorsal cord and drg sema6 and plexina1 remained unaltered. 2011 characterization of the [MASK1] inter- actome in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. 2008 essential role of [MASK1] in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination during postnatal central nervous system development.
