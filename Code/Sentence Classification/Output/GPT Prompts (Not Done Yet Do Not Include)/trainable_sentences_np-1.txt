circumstantial evidence for a role for sema3a and np-1 in neural scar-related angiogenesis................................................................	42this  is  supported  by the observations	involve np-1 or np-2 [174].in contrast, neonatal		olfactory neurons and retinal ganglion cells do either not lot lesions did not lead to sema3a mrna re-expression		affect or even induce neuronal expression of np-1 and/ or at the lesion site and induced vigorous axon regeneration		crmp-2, a cytosolic protein necessary  for  sema3a-in- and	appropriate	re-innervation	of	terminal	fields		duced growth cone collapse [52,55,107,120–122,126].fifth, transfection of np-1 or plexin-a1 in fibroblast-likethe abnormal and their receptors in scar formation	development of the cardio-vascular system of np-1 null mutant and transgenic mice [82–84] and the interaction offactors [61,105,155], points to a prominent role for np-1 in   first, sema3a is able to repel migrating neural crest and angiogenesis.the presence  of  np-1  on  the  surface  of  endothelial cells, an effect mediated by np-1 [45,104], newly formed blood vessels [122] and concomitant infiltra- suggesting that semaphorins expressed by cells in the scar,   tion  of  angiogenic  factors  into  the  injury  site  (e.g.,  ref.such as sema3a, may regulate nonneuronal cell motility     [7]), argues that np-1 represents a crucial component of      during scar formation.expressing plexin-a3 are strong repelling cues for migrat-     this  is  supported  by  the  observation  that  sema3a  can     ing fibroblasts, while introduction of  np-1 / plexin-a1  inhibit endothelial cell motility and microvessel sprouting  complexes  allows  sema3a-mediated  cell  contraction  in vitro, and competes with the angiogenic factor vascular  [173,174].second,  following  penetrating  injuries,  fibro-          endothelial   growth   factor   (vegf)   for   np-1   sites  onthis increased sensitivity may be more,  np-1  mrna  expression  is  unchanged  in  sensory		critical in slowing down the growth of regenerating axons and  motor  neurons  after  nerve  injury,  while  crmp-2		that enter the sema3a-positive endplate region.the injury-induced motor neuron downregulation of sema3a may subserve several putative roles: (i) it could prevent release of sema3a by injured motor sprouts at the injury site thereby temporarily diminishing chemorepulsive signaling in the regenerating nerve and allowing np-1 / plexin-a1-positive drg and motor sprouts to regrow.alternatively, a decrease in sema3a may allow another np-1 ligand, vegf, to occupy receptor sites on schwann cells or axons and exert its axon growth promoting and mitogenic effects.fourth,  number of inhibitory proteins implicated in neural regene-  sema3a can compete with vegf on np-1 sites [104].ration is still relatively small, future work will undoubtedly  therefore,  the  downregulation  of   sema3a   may   allow   result in the identification of more regeneration-associated vegf to bind np-1 on regenerating fibers or nonneuronal   inhibitors, for example as a result of the emergence of new    cells in the injured peripheral nerve.interestingly, several class 3 semaphorins reside sema3a, np-1 and np-2.newly formed orn express np-1 and crmp-2 as they extend axons towards the lesion site in the olfactory bulb.thus, the targeted  deletion  of  the  np-1  gene  resulted  in  func-	knockout of one receptor gene (e.g., np-2) would result in tional defects similar to that observed in sema3a2 / 2 mice		an animal that lacks a binding partner required by multipleantibodies to sema3a, np-1 and np-2 are able to block
