quickly become remyelinated by newly born ols, as suggested in the epon tissue and reporter mice/rats.', 'further, work by  using the mt/mg reporter mouse line used here suggested that new ol-derived myelin segments generated after sci in the', 'rubrospinal tract become progressively thicker and longer, re- sulting in a return to “baseline” conditions.', 'our g-ratio data agree with this because g-ratios in rostral tissue decreased be- tween 4 and 10 wpi (meaning that myelin was thicker).', 'if remy- elinated segments indeed continuously thicken over time  after  sci, the detection herein of thin myelin with short internodes at    2 and 3 months after injury further supports the notion that ol generation and remyelination occur continuously  and  chroni-  cally after sci.', 'the present work also shows that the primary distribution of new ols and remyelination shifts from proximal to the lesion core acutely (first month after injury) to tissue closer to the pial border more chronically (second to third months; ).', 'this could be explained by several mechanisms.', 'first, an acute gradi- ent of oligogenic signals may be highest in areas of greatest demy- elination and damage (lesion epicenter), which induces local progenitor migration, division, and differentiation.', 'the high ex- pression of growth factors (cntf, fgf-2) around the lesion bor- der chronically, however, suggests that if such a gradient exists, it likely remains for several months.', 'a second possibility is that distal axons undergo demyelination more chronically than axons along the lesion border.', 'because demyelinated axons are thought to be vulnerable and do not survive long-term after sci ( ), remyelination in chronic sci likely occurs on axons that had only recently become demyelinated.', 'work by   supports chronic, distal myelin loss because they showed demyelination and ol apoptosis in distal white matter tracts (but not the lesion border) at 3 wpi.', 'our present work showing pathological degeneration of myelin at 10 wpi supports the idea that demyelination may occur chronically after sci.', 'a third possible explanation for chronic distal remyelination is that these areas may contain protracted axon sprouting, which in turn could stimulate oligodendrogenesis.', 'this is not incompatible with the above mechanisms and, indeed, all three may develop concurrently after sci.', 'the present work also illustrates that the chronic lesion envi-', 'ronment remains dynamic, with markedly altered growth factors and cell fate gene expression changes.', 'previous work using im- munohistochemistry and western blot showed that cntf and fgf-2 are elevated for 4 wpi around the lesion border ( ); the present work extends this increased growth factor expression to 12 wpi.', 'cntf is an astrocyte-derived factor that promotes ol lineage cell survival, differentiation, and myelination (, ; ;  ; ).', 'it initiates phosphorylation of stat3 and enhances the effects of fgf-2, which is also impor- tant for oligodendrogenesis (;  ; ).', 'ng2 cells, especially around the lesion, expressed pstat3 for at least 5 wpi, indicating that this pathway remains active in ng2 cells.', 'interestingly, the time frame of peak pstat3 expression in ng2 cells (1–2 wpi) occurs concomitantly with the greatest ng2 cell proliferation ( ).', 'therefore, the chronic sci environment contains robust expression of oligogenic factors that may promote ongo- ing gliogenesis/differentiation.', 'another favorable factor for chronic post-sci oligodendro- genesis was the significant reduction in hes5 and sox11, factors that inhibit ol differentiation.', 'however, at least one factor that prevents oligodendrogenesis, bmp4, progressively increased af- ter sci.', 'bmp4 can push ng2 cells toward an astrocytic fate ( ; ; ), although bmp4 injection into the injured spinal cord actually reduced astrogliosis ().', 'bmp4 can induce id2 and id4', '\\nexpression, transcription factors that inhibit ol differentiation, and, indeed, rna for both factors increased at 2– 4 wpi.', 'there- fore, the chronic injury milieu contains signaling molecules that can both promote and inhibit ol differentiation and myelina- tion.', 'the balance must favor long-term oligodendrogenesis, al- though the progressively increasing anti-oligogenic factors likely contribute to its reduction over time.', 'cell quantification in this study revealed that greatest accu- mulation of new ols after sci was derived from cells differenti- ating between 2 and 5 wpi.', 'present data also show that there was a significant jump in total ol numbers between 4 and 5 wpi, which would suggest that peak new ol formation occurred dur- ing the fourth week after injury.', 'however, it is possible (and even likely) that ol genesis was at least as robust before 4 wpi.', 'indeed, despite a significant reduction in ols at 4 wpi, almost half of the ols in epicenter sections were already gfp+ (and therefore new) at that time, indicating that they had differentiated from progenitors before 4 wpi.', 'therefore, robust ol genesis must oc- cur throughout the first month after injury, which partially com- pensates for ol apoptosis and prevents ol numbers from falling drastically further.', 'in summary, this work demonstrates that the window of', 'spontaneous oligodendrogenesis and remyelination after sci is much longer than previously appreciated.', 'new ols incorporate throughout spared white matter tracks, where they initiate my- elination for at least 3 months after injury.', 'the knowledge of ongoing oligodendrogenesis and fluctuating progliogenic and antigliogenic factors provides insight into the chronic injury mi- lieu, which may be crucial for predicting how strategies such as stem cell transplantation will fare long-term or whether thera- peutically induced regenerated axons will become myelinated.', 'further, this may provide opportunities for leveraging endoge- nous progenitors, thereby obviating the need for exogenous cell transplantation.', 'it is also important to understand the dynamics of this response so that pharmaceutical-based strategies targeting other post-sci pathologies do not interfere with this reparative process.', 'last, knowing the potential negative regulators of oligo- dendrogenesis may provide new targets for treatments aimed at enhancing myelination of either spared or newly regenerated axons.', 'references', 'barnabe´-heider f, go¨ritz c, sabelstro¨m h, takebayashi h, pfrieger fw, meletis k, frise´n j

sci.', 'similarly, the extent of post-sci demyelina- tion and its clinical importance have been discussed and debated (for reviews, see ; ).', 'the belief that ol loss and demyelination are important therapeutic targets after sci has led to multiple preclinical transplantation studies with the goal of replacing ols and promoting remyelina- tion; these studies demonstrated varying degrees of improved remyelination and/or functional recovery ( ; ; ; ), with work by forming the basis for a phase 1 clinical trial in acute sci patients.', 'therefore, ol replacement is clearly viewed as a valuable clinical target.', 'given that, it is somewhat surprising that the duration of spontaneous oligodendrogenesis has not received more atten- tion.', 'adult progenitors are highly responsive to injury and can proliferate, differentiate, and remyelinate axons ( ), and studies have shown all these responses occur during the first 2 weeks post-sci (;  ; ; ; ; ;  ).', 'how long this reparative response continues, however, is unknown.', 'using cre-er technology and a gfp-expressing retrovirus, we tracked the long-term post-sci fate of progenitors in mice and rats, respectively, to determine the duration of oligodendrogen- esis and remyelination.', 'because retroviruses only incorporate into dividing cells, this approach allowed us to examine whether cells dividing after injury survive and/or differentiate into ols.', 'the results verified that ng2 cells proliferate for at least 4 wpi in rats and that new cells accumulate around the lesion border/glial scar and incorporate into the surrounding spared tissue.', 'in mice,', 'figure 12. schematic illustrating change in pattern of new oligogenesis occurring at different times after sci.', 'between 1 dpi and 4 wpi, most new ols were generated around the lesion border with scattered new cells distally as well.', 'between 2 and 5 wpi, oligogenesis was more robust but still primarily concentrated around the lesion border.', 'between 3 and 6 wpi, fewer new ols were generated around the lesion border and instead were mostly located along distal pial borders and throughout the dorsal column.', 'between 6 and 9 wpi, most new ols were found in distal spared white matter along the pial border with few new ols generated along lesion borders.', 'progenitor fate was tracked by inducing gfp/yfp in pdgfra- expressing cells at different times after injury.', 'this also revealed a chronic accumulation of progenitors at a higher than normal density, which is consistent with data showing ng2 cell density in spared tissue is 2–3x higher at 6 wpi compared with naive ().', 'the present data show that new ols were produced as late as the 2 months after injury in rats (the latest time examined) and 3 months after injury in mice.', 'new gfp+ ols were generated throughout spared white and gray matter adjacent to the lesion and 4 –5 mm distal to epicenter, showing widespread and pro- tracted gliogenesis.', 'gfp+ ol processes wrapped axons, ex- pressed mbp, and abutted caspr+ profiles, indicative of functional myelination and formation of paranodal junctions.', 'therefore, endogenous progenitors undergo oligodendrogenesis for at least 3 months after injury, during which new ols myelin-', '\\nate/remyelinate axons.', 'although central canal ependymal cells also divide after sci and produce a small number of ols after dorsal spinal hemisection (), retrovirus injec- tions in the present study were directed into the contusion epi- center in which all ependymal cells were killed, suggesting that their contribution, if anything, was minimal.', 'a point of controversy may be that long-term demyelination after sci has not been widely reported, raising the question of exactly which axons did new ols wrap?', 'however, it may be ex- actly because of the unappreciated chronic production of new ols that widespread demyelination is not typically noted.', 'if ax- ons are continually demyelinated over time, they may quickly become remyelinated by newly born ols, as suggested in the epon tissue and reporter mice/rats.', 'further, work by  using the mt/mg reporter mouse line used here suggested that new ol-derived myelin segments generated after sci in the', 'rubrospinal tract become progressively thicker and longer, re- sulting in a return to “baseline” conditions.', 'our g-ratio data agree with this because g-ratios in rostral tissue decreased be- tween 4 and 10 wpi (meaning that myelin was thicker).', 'if remy- elinated segments indeed continuously thicken over time  after  sci, the detection herein of thin myelin with short internodes at    2 and 3 months after injury further supports the notion that ol generation and remyelination occur continuously  and  chroni-  cally after sci.', 'the present work also shows that the primary distribution of new ols and remyelination shifts from proximal to the lesion core acutely (first month after injury) to tissue closer to the pial border more chronically (second to third months; ).', 'this could be explained by several mechanisms.', 'first, an acute gradi- ent of oligogenic signals may be highest in areas of greatest demy- elination and damage (lesion epicenter), which induces local progenitor migration, division, and differentiation.', 'the high ex- pression of growth factors (cntf, fgf-2) around the lesion bor- der chronically, however, suggests that if such a gradient exists, it likely remains for several months.', 'a second possibility is that distal axons undergo demyelination more chronically than axons along the lesion border.', 'because demyelinated axons are thought to be vulnerable and do not survive long-term after sci ( ), remyelination in chronic sci likely occurs on axons that had only recently become demyelinated.', 'work by   supports chronic, distal myelin loss because they showed demyelination and ol apoptosis in distal white matter tracts (but not the lesion border) at 3 wpi.', 'our present work showing pathological degeneration of myelin at 10 wpi supports the idea that demyelination may occur chronically after sci.', 'a third possible explanation for chronic distal remyelination is that these areas may contain protracted axon sprouting, which in turn could stimulate oligodendrogenesis.', 'this is not incompatible with the above mechanisms and, indeed, all three may develop concurrently after sci.', 'the present work also illustrates that the chronic lesion envi-', 'ronment remains dynamic, with markedly altered growth factors and cell fate gene expression changes.', 'previous work using im- munohistochemistry and western blot showed that cntf and fgf-2 are elevated for 4 wpi around the lesion border ( ); the present work extends this increased growth factor expression to 12 wpi.', 'cntf is an astrocyte-derived factor that promotes ol lineage cell survival, differentiation, and myelination (, ; ;  ; ).', 'it initiates phosphorylation of stat3 and enhances the effects of fgf-2, which is also impor- tant for oligodendrogenesis (;  ; ).', 'ng2 cells, especially around the lesion, expressed pstat3 for at least 5 wpi, indicating that this pathway remains active in ng2 cells.', 'interestingly, the time frame of peak pstat3 expression in ng2 cells (1–2 wpi) occurs concomitantly with the greatest ng2 cell proliferation ( ).', 'therefore, the chronic sci environment contains robust expression of oligogenic factors that may promote ongo- ing gliogenesis/differentiation.', 'another favorable factor for chronic post-sci oligodendro- genesis was the significant reduction in hes5 and sox11, factors that inhibit ol differentiation.', 'however, at least one factor that prevents oligodendrogenesis, bmp4, progressively increased af- ter sci.', 'bmp4 can push ng2 cells toward an astrocytic fate ( ; ; ), although bmp4 injection into the injured spinal cord actually reduced astrogliosis ().', 'bmp4 can induce id2 and id4', '\\nexpression, transcription factors that inhibit ol differentiation, and, indeed, rna for both factors increased at 2– 4 wpi.', 'there- fore, the chronic injury milieu contains signaling molecules that can both promote and inhibit ol differentiation and myelina- tion.', 'the balance must favor long-term oligodendrogenesis, al- though the progressively increasing anti-oligogenic factors likely contribute to its reduction over time.', 'cell quantification in this study revealed that greatest accu- mulation of new ols after sci was derived from cells differenti- ating between 2 and 5 wpi.', 'present data also show that there was a significant jump in total ol numbers between 4 and 5 wpi, which would suggest that peak new ol formation occurred dur- ing the fourth week after injury.', 'however, it is possible (and even likely) that ol genesis was at least as robust before 4 wpi.', 'indeed, despite a significant reduction in ols at 4 wpi, almost half of the ols in epicenter sections were already gfp+ (and therefore new) at that time, indicating that they had differentiated from progenitors before 4 wpi.', 'therefore, robust ol genesis must oc- cur throughout the first month after injury, which partially com- pensates for ol apoptosis and prevents ol numbers from falling drastically further.', 'in summary, this work demonstrates that the window of', 'spontaneous oligodendrogenesis and remyelination after sci is much longer than previously appreciated.', 'new ols incorporate throughout spared white matter tracks, where they initiate my- elination for at least 3 months after injury.', 'the knowledge of ongoing oligodendrogenesis and fluctuating progliogenic and antigliogenic factors provides insight into the chronic injury mi- lieu, which may be crucial for predicting how strategies such as stem cell transplantation will fare long-term or whether thera- peutically induced regenerated axons will become myelinated.', 'further, this may provide opportunities for leveraging endoge- nous progenitors, thereby obviating the need for exogenous cell transplantation.', 'it is also important to understand the dynamics of this response so that pharmaceutical-based strategies targeting other post-sci pathologies do not interfere with this reparative process.', 'last, knowing the potential negative regulators of oligo- dendrogenesis may provide new targets for treatments aimed at enhancing myelination of either spared or newly regenerated axons.', 'references', 'barnabe´-heider f, go¨ritz c, sabelstro¨m h, takebayashi h, pfrieger fw, meletis k, frise´n j

patients with sci at different time points 24 hours day 3 and day 7 and in healthy subjects. we sought to determine the plasma concentrations of [MASK1] and hgf which represent the main chemoat- tractive factors contributing to trafficking migration and homing of bm-derived spcs including  epcs  and subsequent vascular repair or angiogenesis at the vascular injury sitetable hgf plasma level was found to be markedly higher in patients with sci at each of time points 24 hours day 3 and day 7 compared to healthy subjects with peak  concentrat- ion at day 3 post-injury median 1635 vs 593 pgml  p  00001. surprisingly we found a significantly lower [MASK1] concentration in patients with sci during the first 3 days after acute  sci compared to healthy subjects median 1519 and 1539 vs 2228 pgml p  00001 for 24 hours and day 3 respectively. the [MASK1] levels returned to those found in healthy subjects at day 7 post-sci. we observed a significant increase in [MASK1] levels at day  7 compared to 24 hours and day 3 post-injury. this may suggest that [MASK1] does not play  a  supportive role in organism response to sci. in a number of tissue damage the level of [MASK1] has been found elevated and its role in spontaneous mobilization of spcs has been appreci- ated. it has been hypothesized that secretion of [MASK1] by ischemic tissue following injury may induce an egress of epcs from the bm and recruitment through the reversal of the bm [MASK1] gradient. it has been hypothesized that secretion of [MASK1] by ischemic tissue following injury may induce an egress of epcs from the bm and recruitment through the reversal of the bm [MASK1] gradient. cxcr4 one  of two unique receptors of [MASK1] is highly expressed on epcs. our previous study also demonstrated that [MASK1] concentration gradually increases in  acute phase of ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke in patients. in the current study we demonstrate a low concentration of plasma [MASK1] during the first days post-injury with a return to the level that was observed in healthy subjects on day 7 after sci. hence [MASK1] did not seem to contribute in epcs egress from  the  bm in patients with sci. in contrast at the lesion site in sci a peak in [MASK1] expression has been found at   7 days post-injury and it correlated positively with the recruitment of stem cells which were injected into the blood stream. together these observations indicate  an important role of [MASK1] in spc homing to the site of tissue spinal cord damage but not in the egress of these cells from the bm in sci. taking into consideration a lack of elevation of vegf and [MASK1] plasma levels in patients with sci we do not rule out the possibility that an increased secretion of hgf may promote egress of bm-derived epcs into circulation. the possible explanation of the delayed cellular response might be a lack of an increase in concentration of the potent chemoattractive factors such as [MASK1] and vegf. 2011 [MASK1] in the dorsal corticospinal tract promotes cxcr4 cell migration after spinal cord injury. the discovery of sdf-1y a novel stromal cell-derived factor [MASK1] isoform the expression of this

the discovery of sdf-1y a novel stromal cell-derived factor [MASK1] isoform the expression of this chemokine by schwann cells and the moderate increase of [MASK1] isoform expression in the lesioned nerve provided the basis for another signalling system operating in the peripheral nervous system 40. at present it is not clear whether this is a paracrine mechanism acting between schwann cells or whether [MASK1] binding to the cxcr4 receptor 41 occurs on axonal surfaces. sdf-1gamma a novel [MASK1] chemokine transcript with developmentally regulated expression in the nervous system. the
