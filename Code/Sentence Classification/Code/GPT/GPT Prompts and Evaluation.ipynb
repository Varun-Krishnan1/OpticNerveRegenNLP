patients with sci at different time points 24 hours day 3 and day 7 and in healthy subjects. we sought to determine the plasma concentrations of [MASK1] and hgf which represent the main chemoat- tractive factors contributing to trafficking migration and homing of bm-derived spcs including  epcs  and subsequent vascular repair or angiogenesis at the vascular injury sitetable hgf plasma level was found to be markedly higher in patients with sci at each of time points 24 hours day 3 and day 7 compared to healthy subjects with peak  concentrat- ion at day 3 post-injury median 1635 vs 593 pgml  p  00001. surprisingly we found a significantly lower [MASK1] concentration in patients with sci during the first 3 days after acute  sci compared to healthy subjects median 1519 and 1539 vs 2228 pgml p  00001 for 24 hours and day 3 respectively. the [MASK1] levels returned to those found in healthy subjects at day 7 post-sci. we observed a significant increase in [MASK1] levels at day  7 compared to 24 hours and day 3 post-injury. this may suggest that [MASK1] does not play  a  supportive role in organism response to sci. in a number of tissue damage the level of [MASK1] has been found elevated and its role in spontaneous mobilization of spcs has been appreci- ated. it has been hypothesized that secretion of [MASK1] by ischemic tissue following injury may induce an egress of epcs from the bm and recruitment through the reversal of the bm [MASK1] gradient. it has been hypothesized that secretion of [MASK1] by ischemic tissue following injury may induce an egress of epcs from the bm and recruitment through the reversal of the bm [MASK1] gradient. cxcr4 one  of two unique receptors of [MASK1] is highly expressed on epcs. our previous study also demonstrated that [MASK1] concentration gradually increases in  acute phase of ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke in patients. in the current study we demonstrate a low concentration of plasma [MASK1] during the first days post-injury with a return to the level that was observed in healthy subjects on day 7 after sci. hence [MASK1] did not seem to contribute in epcs egress from  the  bm in patients with sci. in contrast at the lesion site in sci a peak in [MASK1] expression has been found at   7 days post-injury and it correlated positively with the recruitment of stem cells which were injected into the blood stream. together these observations indicate  an important role of [MASK1] in spc homing to the site of tissue spinal cord damage but not in the egress of these cells from the bm in sci. taking into consideration a lack of elevation of vegf and [MASK1] plasma levels in patients with sci we do not rule out the possibility that an increased secretion of hgf may promote egress of bm-derived epcs into circulation. the possible explanation of the delayed cellular response might be a lack of an increase in concentration of the potent chemoattractive factors such as [MASK1] and vegf. 2011 [MASK1] in the dorsal corticospinal tract promotes cxcr4 cell migration after spinal cord injury. the discovery of sdf-1y a novel stromal cell-derived factor [MASK1] isoform the expression of this chemokine by schwann cells and the moderate increase of [MASK1] isoform expression in the lesioned nerve provided the basis for another signalling system operating in the peripheral nervous system 40. the discovery of sdf-1y a novel stromal cell-derived factor [MASK1] isoform the expression of this chemokine by schwann cells and the moderate increase of [MASK1] isoform expression in the lesioned nerve provided the basis for another signalling system operating in the peripheral nervous system 40. at present it is not clear whether this is a paracrine mechanism acting between schwann cells or whether [MASK1] binding to the cxcr4 receptor 41 occurs on axonal surfaces. sdf-1gamma a novel [MASK1] chemokine transcript with developmentally regulated expression in the nervous system. the
