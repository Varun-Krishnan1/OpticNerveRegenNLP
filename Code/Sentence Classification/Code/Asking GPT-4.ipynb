This is supported by the fact that 'np-1' can inhibit endothelial cell motility and microvessel sprouting, and it competes with the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for np-1 sites. Additionally, the downregulation of sema3a may allow another np-1 ligand, VEGF, to occupy receptor sites on Schwann cells or axons and exert its axon growth promoting and mitogenic effects. The presence of np-1 on the surface of endothelial cells suggests that semaphorins expressed by cells in the scar, such as sema3a, may regulate nonneuronal cell motility during scar formation. Therefore, based on the given sentences, it appears that 'np-1' is a promoter of optic nerve inhibition."],"metadata":{"id":"IfQCt6KPjTUI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**NP-1 MASKED GPT-4 conclusion:**  \n","Based on the provided sentences, it appears that the molecule [molecule] inhibits optic nerve inhibition.
